Just spoke to @KanyeWest about his friend A$AP Rocky’s incarceration. I will be calling the very talented Prime Minister of Sweden to see what we can do about helping A$AP Rocky. So many people would like to see this quickly resolved!
The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment. We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World! If Iran attacks an American Base or any American we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!

Had a very good conversation with the newly elected President of Brazil Jair Bolsonaro who won his race by a substantial margin. We agreed that Brazil and the United States will work closely together on Trade Military and everything else! Excellent call wished him congrats!
It is amazing that I became President of the United States with such a totally corrupt and dishonest Lamestream Media going after me all day and all night. Either I’m really good far better than the Fake News wants to admit or they don’t have nearly the power as once thought!
I won the debate big based on compilation of polls etc. Thank you!
Give A$AP Rocky his FREEDOM. We do so much for Sweden but it doesn’t seem to work the other way around. Sweden should focus on its real crime problem! #FreeRocky
Our Country is Free Beautiful and Very Successful. If you hate our Country or if you are not happy here you can leave!
Remember the Cure can’t be worse than the problem itself. Be careful be safe use common sense!
Play College Football!
To Iranian President Rouhani: NEVER EVER THREATEN THE UNITED STATES AGAIN OR YOU WILL SUFFER CONSEQUENCES THE LIKES OF WHICH FEW THROUGHOUT HISTORY HAVE EVER SUFFERED BEFORE. WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH. BE CAUTIOUS!
Iran never won a war but never lost a negotiation!
BORING!
The National Guard has arrived on the scene. They are in Minneapolis and fully prepared. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!
Upon information and belief Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on U.S. troops and/or assets in Iraq. If this happens Iran will pay a very heavy price indeed!
HUGE breakthrough today! Historic Peace Agreement between our two GREAT friends Israel and the United Arab Emirates!
First thing the anarchists did upon taking over Seattle was "BUILD A WALL". See I was ahead of our times!
It was a great and triumphant evening for our Country. Thank you for all of the nice remarks and wonderful reviews of my State of the Union Speech. It was my great honor to have done it!

My warmest condolences and sympathies to the victims and families of the terrible Las Vegas shooting. God bless you!
So disgusting to watch Twitter’s so-called "Trending" where sooo many trends are about me and never a good one. They look for anything they can find make it as bad as possible and blow it up trying to make it trend. Really ridiculous illegal and of course very unfair!
THE SILENT MAJORITY IS STRONGER THAN EVER JUST WATCH!!!
LAW & ORDER!
These are "Organized Groups" that have nothing to do with George Floyd. Sad!
I can’t stand back & watch this happen to a great American City Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor Jacob Frey get his act together and bring the City under control or I will send in the National Guard & get the job done right.....
Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback under immense pressure. We are proud of you and the Great State of Missouri. You are true Champions!

This year has seen the lowest crime numbers in our Country’s recorded history and now the Radical Left Democrats want to Defund and Abandon our Police. Sorry I want LAW & ORDER!
I always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously and have done a very good job from the beginning including my very early decision to close the "borders" from China - against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful & false!
In 47 years Joe did none of the things of which he now speaks. He will never change just words!
Cases numbers and deaths are going down all over the Country!
All over the World the CoronaVirus a very bad "gift" from China marches on. Not good!
I LOVE @GoyaFoods!
The Lamestream Media is doing everything within their power to foment hatred and anarchy. As long as everybody understands what they are doing that they are FAKE NEWS and truly bad people with a sick agenda we can easily work through them to GREATNESS!
As I watch the Pandemic spread its ugly face all across the world including the tremendous damage it has done to the USA I become more and more angry at China. People can see it and I can feel it!
The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit thinking of our leaders as fools. They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan with little help. No more!
HE SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN AND GOT CAUGHT!
Wow! The wonderful Iranian protesters refused to step on or in any way denigrate our Great American Flag. It was put on the street in order for them to trample it and they walked around it instead. Big progress!
So Obama and his team of lowlifes spied on my campaign and got caught - Open and shut case! More papers released today which are devastating to them. Will they ever pay the price? The political Crime of the Century!
The Dow Jones Industrial just closed above 29000! You are so lucky to have me as your President😉With Joe Hiden’ it would crash😧

BUILDING THE WALL!
Pelosi is holding up STIMULUS not the Republicans!
I will be making a public statement tomorrow at 12:00pm from the @WhiteHouse to discuss our Country’s VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax!
All Democrats just raised their hands for giving millions of illegal aliens unlimited healthcare. How about taking care of American Citizens first!? That’s the end of that race!
Great News on Vaccines!
STIMULUS! Go big or go home!!!
Crazy "Nancy Pelosi you are a weak person. You are a poor leader. You are the reason America hates career politicians like yourself." @seanhannity She is totally incompetent & controlled by the Radical Left a weak and pathetic puppet. Come back to Washington and do your job!
How does Biden lead in Pennsylvania Polls when he is against Fracking (JOBS!) 2nd Amendment and Religion? Fake Polls. I will win Pennsylvania!
So last year 37000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27000 and 70000 per year. Nothing is shut down life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus with 22 deaths. Think about that!
Great job by @elonmusk in agreeing to build in TEXAS what is expected to be the largest auto plant anywhere in the world. He kept his word to me. Texas & @Tesla are big winners. MADE IN THE USA!
The Ten Most Dangerous Cities in the U.S. are ALL run by Democrats and this has gone on for DECADES!
2016? HERE WE GO AGAIN!
The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am  the hardest working President in history. I don’t know about that but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history. The Fake News hates it!
THE VAST SILENT MAJORITY IS ALIVE AND WELL!!! We will win this Election big. Nobody wants a Low IQ person in charge of our Country and Sleepy Joe is definitely a Low IQ person!
California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant NOW. It can be done Fast & Safely!

You can’t Impeach someone who hasn’t done anything wrong!
Sleepy Joe Biden and the Radical Left Democrats want to "DEFUND THE POLICE". I want great and well paid LAW ENFORCEMENT. I want LAW & ORDER!
Sleepy Joe has been in politics for 40 years and did nothing. Now he pretends to have the answers. He doesn’t even know the questions. Weakness will never beat anarchists looters or thugs and Joe has been politically weak all of his life. LAW & ORDER!

Get tough Democrat Mayors and Governors. These people are ANARCHISTS. Call in our National Guard NOW. The World is watching and laughing at you and Sleepy Joe. Is this what America wants? NO!!!
Much smaller crowd in D.C. than anticipated. National Guard Secret Service and D.C. Police have been doing a fantastic job. Thank you!
I just had the privilege of signing a very strong Executive Order protecting American Monuments Memorials and Statues - and combatting recent Criminal Violence. Long prison terms for these lawless acts against our Great Country!

Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!
As hard as I work & as successful as our Country has become with our Economy our Military & everything else it is ashame that the Democrats make us spend so much time & money on this ridiculous Impeachment Lite Hoax. I should be able to devote all of my time to the REAL USA!
LAW & ORDER!
Nancy Pelosi says she got "set up" by a Beauty Parlor owner. Maybe the Beauty Parlor owner should be running the House of Representatives instead of Crazy Nancy?
Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail LaVar Ball the father of LiAngelo is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!

I am looking forward to the debate on the evening of Thursday October 15th in Miami. It will be great!
Interesting how ANTIFA and other Far Left militant groups can take over a city without barely a wimpier from soft Do Nothing Democrat leadership  yet these same weak leaders become RADICAL when it comes to shutting down a state or city and its hard working tax paying citizens!
96-0 in the United States Senate. Congratulations AMERICA!
China has just announced a doubling in the number of their deaths from the Invisible Enemy. It is far higher than that and far higher than the U.S. not even close!

Congratulations to the @nypost for having exposed the massive corruption surrounding Sleepy Joe Biden and our Country. He’s always been a corrupt politician. Disgraceful!

Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually he is weak both mentally and physically and yet he threatens me for the second time with physical assault. He doesn’t know me but he would go down fast and hard crying all the way. Don’t threaten people Joe!
I will NEVER allow our great Second Amendment to go unprotected not even a little bit!

I will be strongly demanding a Drug Test of Sleepy Joe Biden prior to or after the Debate on Tuesday night. Naturally I will agree to take one also. His Debate performances have been record setting UNEVEN to put it mildly. Only drugs could have caused this discrepancy???
Looting leads to shooting and that’s why a man was shot and killed in Minneapolis on Wednesday night - or look at what just happened in Louisville with 7 people shot. I don’t want this to happen and that’s what the expression put out last night means....
FAKE NEWS!
BUT DIDN’T SHE CALL HIM A RACIST??? DIDN’T SHE SAY HE WAS INCOMPETENT???
Since imposing a very powerful 10 year prison sentence on those that Vandalize Monuments Statues etc. with many people being arrested all over our Country the Vandalism has completely stopped. Thank you!
It is ashame that Congress doesn’t do something about the lowlifes that burn the American Flag. It should be stopped and now!
Tremendous success tonight. Thank you to all!

Biden REFUSED to use the term LAW & ORDER! There go the Suburbs.
General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many more...but got caught! He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people including the recent large number....
Crazy Nancy Pelosi is looking at the 25th Amendment in order to replace Joe Biden with Kamala Harris. The Dems want that to happen fast because Sleepy Joe is out of it!!!

Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle run by Radical Left Democrats of course. LAW & ORDER!
With Universal Mail-In Voting (not Absentee Voting which is good) 2020 will be the most INACCURATE & FRAUDULENT Election in history. It will be a great embarrassment to the USA. Delay the Election until people can properly securely and safely vote???
D.C. had no problems last night. Many arrests. Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise Minneapolis was great (thank you President Trump!).
The World Health Organization just admitted that I was right. Lockdowns are killing countries all over the world. The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. Open up your states Democrat governors. Open up New York. A long battle but they finally did the right thing!
SAVE THE POST OFFICE!
ISIS has a new leader. We know exactly who he is!

If Iran wants to fight that will be the official end of Iran. Never threaten the United States again!
Joe Biden has said he would lock down the Country again. That’s crazy! We’re having record job growth and a booming stock market but Joe would end it all and close it all down. Ridiculous!

In 3 1/2 years I’ve done much more for our Black population than Joe Biden has done in 43 years. Actually he set them back big time with his Crime Bill which he doesn’t even remember. I’ve done more for Black Americans in fact than any President in U.S. history with...
So pathetic to watch the Fake News Lamestream Media playing down the gravity and depravity of the Radical Left looters and thugs ripping up our Liberal Democrat run (only) cities. It is almost like they are all working together?
Very disappointed in Prime Minister Stefan Löfven for being unable to act. Sweden has let our African American Community down in the United States. I watched the tapes of A$AP Rocky and he was being followed and harassed by troublemakers. Treat Americans fairly! #FreeRocky
Tony Fauci has nothing to do with NFL Football. They are planning a very safe and controlled opening. However if they don’t stand for our National Anthem and our Great American Flag I won’t be watching!!!
Wow. @CNN got caught cold manipulating the words and meaning of my 4th of July Speech. They were brazen desperate. Watch what happens!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Congratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis Minnesota last night. The ANTIFA led anarchists among others were shut down quickly. Should have been done by Mayor on first night and there would have been no trouble!
After all that I have done for the Military our great Veterans Judges (99) Justices (2) Tax & Regulation Cuts the Economy Energy Trade & MUCH MORE does anybody really think I won’t build the WALL? Done more in first two years than any President! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
President and Mrs. Obama built/has a ten foot Wall around their D.C. mansion/compound. I agree totally necessary for their safety and security. The U.S. needs the same thing slightly larger version!
BIGGEST TAX CUT EVER AND ANOTHER ONE COMING. VOTE!
The Democrats took the word GOD out of the Pledge of Allegiance at the Democrat National Convention. At first I thought they made a mistake but it wasn’t. It was done on purpose. Remember Evangelical Christians and ALL this is where they are coming from-it’s done. Vote Nov 3!
People are proud to be saying Merry Christmas again. I am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase. MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!!
Great Ratings & Reviews Last Night. Thank you!
So now Schumer and Pelosi want to meet to make a deal. Amazing how it all works isn’t it. Where have they been for the last 4 weeks when they were "hardliners" and only wanted BAILOUT MONEY for Democrat run states and cities that are failing badly? They know my phone number!
If I wasn’t constantly harassed for three years by fake and illegal investigations Russia Russia Russia and the Impeachment Hoax I’d be up by 25 points on Sleepy Joe and the Do Nothing Democrats. Very unfair but it is what it is!!!

Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!
The LameStream Media is the dominant force in trying to get me to keep our Country closed as long as possible in the hope that it will be detrimental to my election success. The real people want to get back to work ASAP.  We will be stronger than ever before!
Colin Powell a real stiff who was very responsible for getting us into the disastrous Middle East Wars just announced he will be voting for another stiff Sleepy Joe Biden. Didn’t Powell say that Iraq had "weapons of mass destruction?" They didn’t but off we went to WAR!
Very appreciative that @CNN covered the vast majority of the Republican Convention last night. That was really good for CNN while at the same time being good for our Country. Thank you!
You don’t hand matches to an arsonist and you don’t give power to an angry left-wing mob. Democrats have become too EXTREME and TOO DANGEROUS to govern. Republicans believe in the rule of law - not the rule of the mob. VOTE REPUBLICAN!
THANK YOU to our Police Officers Fire Fighters and EMS who help us defeat the Virus every day. Our proud nation is grateful for the unwavering dedication and sacrifice of our First Responders and their families. TOGETHER we will beat this!

Joe Biden claims to be prioritizing ‘safety of kids’ by keeping schools closed this Fall. Yet he remains silent about children being slaughtered by violence on the streets of Democrat run cities. You & your children won’t be SAFE in Biden’s America and neither will anyone else!
If you watch Fake News @CNN or MSDNC you would think that the killers terrorists arsonists anarchists thugs hoodlums looters ANTIFA & others would be the nicest kindest most wonderful people in the Whole Wide World. No they are what they are - very bad for our Country!
The problem is not the very talented low-flying helicopter pilots wanting to save our city the problem is the arsonists looters criminals and anarchists wanting to destroy it (and our Country)!
The Democrat House wants to pass a Bill this week that will destroy our police. Republican Congressmen & Congresswomen will hopefully fight hard to defeat it. We must protect and cherish our police they keep us safe!
We have more Cases because we do more Testing. It’s Lamestream Media Gold!
I will be delivering brief remarks from the Rose Garden at 6:30 P.M. Eastern to update on the Federal Response.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
.@JussieSmollett - what about MAGA and the tens of millions of people you insulted with your racist and dangerous comments!? #MAGA
The United States condemns the terror attack in Barcelona Spain and will do whatever is necessary to help. Be tough & strong we love you!
Like many I don’t watch Saturday Night Live (even though I past hosted it) - no longer funny no talent or charm. It is just a political ad for the Dems. Word is that Kanye West who put on a MAGA hat after the show (despite being told "no") was great. He’s leading the charge!
Death Rate from Coronavirus is down tenfold!
BUILD A WALL & CRIME WILL FALL!
We are doing far more and better Testing than any other country in the world and yet the media does nothing but complain. No matter how good a job is done the same as with the Ventilators they will never say we are doing a great job they will only viciously gripe!
I was right again! Steve Scully just admitted he was lying about his Twitter being hacked. The Debate was Rigged! He was suspended from @cspan indefinitely. The Trump Campaign was not treated fairly by the "Commission". Did I show good instincts in being the first to know?
TRUTH IS A FORCE OF NATURE!
LAW & ORDER!
I watch and listen to the Fake News CNN MSDNC ABC NBC CBS some of FOX (desperately & foolishly pleading to be politically correct) the @nytimes & the @washingtonpost and all I see is hatred of me at any cost. Don’t they understand that they are destroying themselves?
Just had a wonderful conversation with my friend Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan who will be leaving office soon. Shinzo will soon be recognized as the greatest Prime Minister in the history of Japan whose relationship with the USA is the best it has ever been. Special man!
Cases are going up in the U.S. because we are testing far more than any other country and ever expanding. With smaller testing we would show fewer cases!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Did you see where Joe Biden — as Weak Tired and Sleepy as he is went to a Polling Place today in Delaware (of course!) to VOTE!? If Biden can do it any American can do it!
We will be substantially LOWERING Medicare Premiums and Prescription Drug Prices bringing them down to levels that were not thought possible!
Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois as example) and cities in all cases Democrat run and managed when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help? I am open to discussing anything but just asking?
January 20th 2017 will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again.
Pete Rose played Major League Baseball for 24 seasons from 1963-1986 and had more hits 4256 than any other player (by a wide margin). He gambled but only on his own team winning and paid a decades long price. GET PETE ROSE INTO THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME. It’s Time!
This week in only 4 days we had the biggest Stock Market increase since 1974. We have a great chance for the really big bounce when the Invisible Enemy is gone!
There has never been in the history of our Country a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now even in the midst of a National Emergency the Invisible Enemy!
Are you better off now than you were three years ago? Almost everyone say YES!
President George H.W. Bush led a long successful and beautiful life.  Whenever I was with him I saw his absolute joy for life and true pride in his family. His accomplishments were great from beginning to end. He was a truly wonderful man and will be missed by all!
Remember I wouldn’t be President now had Obama and Biden properly done their job. The fact is they were TERRIBLE!!!
People are tired of watching the highly political @NBA. Basketball ratings are WAY down and they won’t be coming back. I hope football and baseball are watching and learning because the same thing will be happening to them. Stand tall for our Country and our Flag!!!
Many States moving to SAFELY & QUICKLY reopen!
Once we OPEN UP OUR GREAT COUNTRY and it will be sooner rather than later the horror of the Invisible Enemy except for those that sadly lost a family member or friend must be quickly forgotten. Our Economy will BOOM perhaps like never before!!!
LAW & ORDER!
The Far Left Fake News Media which had no Covid problem with the Rioters & Looters destroying Democrat run cities is trying to Covid Shame us on our big Rallies. Won’t work!
Yesterday I signed four measures that will massively reduce the prices of prescription drugs in many cases by more than 50%. Nothing like this has ever been done before because Big Pharma with its vast power would not let it happen. Expensive Insulin went from big dollars.....
Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitatingtherefore invitation is withdrawn!
OIL (ENERGY) IS BACK!!!!
Why is Nancy Pelosi getting paid when people who are working are not?
Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is we don’t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding of course)!
The Gallup Poll has just come out with the incredible finding that 56% of you say that you are better off today during a pandemic than you were four years ago (OBiden). Highest number on record! Pretty amazing!
"If carefully done according to the guidelines there is no reason why you shouldn’t be able to do that (vote at polling place)." Doctor Anthony Fauci
Nancy Pelosi will go down as the absolute worst Speaker of the House in U.S. history!
Big Stock Market Numbers!
....Twitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH and I as President will not allow it to happen!
Just spoke to Prime Minister @NarendraModi where I congratulated him on his big political victory. He is a great man and leader for the people of India - they are lucky to have him!
So Crooked Hillary Clinton can delete and acid wash 33000 emails AFTER getting a Subpoena from the United States Congress but I can’t make one totally appropriate telephone call to the President of Ukraine? Witch Hunt!
Big WIN for us in Iowa tonight. Thank you!
Congratulations to the Philadelphia Eagles on a great Super Bowl victory!
I am so proud of our great Country. God bless America!
California has been forced to cancel the massive bullet train project after having spent and wasted many billions of dollars. They owe the Federal Government three and a half billion dollars. We want that money back now. Whole project is a "green" disaster!
What’s going on almost nobody is showing up for Sleepy Joe rallies!
Just In: Chinese State Media and Leaders of CHINA want Biden to win "the U.S. Election".  If this happened (which it won’t) China would own our Country and our Record Setting Stock Markets would literally CRASH!
Congratulations to Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on becoming the next President of Mexico. I look very much forward to working with him. There is much to be done that will benefit both the United States and Mexico!
This is not about the ridiculous Green New Deal. It is about putting our great workers and companies BACK TO WORK!
Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail and probably more. Joe doesn’t know anything about it he is clueless but they will be the real power not Joe. They will be calling the shots! Big tax increases for all Plus!
Great Jobs Numbers!
So interesting to see "Progressive" Democrat Congresswomen who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe the worst most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world (if they even have a functioning government at all) now loudly......
I stand stronger than anyone in protecting your Healthcare with Pre-Existing Conditions. I am honored to have terminated the very unfair costly and unpopular individual mandate for you!
In the beautiful Midwest windchill temperatures are reaching minus 60 degrees the coldest ever recorded. In coming days expected to get even colder. People can’t last outside even for minutes. What the hell is going on with Global Waming? Please come back fast we need you!
Corrupt Joe Biden wants to defund our police. He may use different words but when you look at his pact with Crazy Bernie and other things that’s what he wants to do. It would destroy America!
Saddened to hear the news of civil rights hero John Lewis passing. Melania and I send our prayers to he and his family.
The Governor of Michigan should give a little and put out the fire. These are very good people but they are angry. They want their lives back again safely! See them talk to them make a deal.
LIBERATE MICHIGAN!
Law & Order in Philadelphia NOW! They are looting stores. Call in our great National Guard like they FINALLY did (thank you President Trump) last night in Minneapolis. Is this what voters want with Sleepy Joe? All Dems!
Beautiful weather all over our great country a perfect day for all Women to March. Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months. Lowest female unemployment in 18 years!
Who can figure out the true meaning of "covfefe" ???  Enjoy!
HAPPY EASTER!
Not only will Sleepy Joe Biden DEFUND THE POLICE but he will DEFUND OUR MILITARY! He has no choice the Dems are controlled by the Radical Left.
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS!
Corrupt Joe Biden said yesterday that we have over "120 million" people dead of Coronavirus!
Kim Jong Un is in good health. Never underestimate him!
Seattle Mayor says about the anarchists takeover of her city "it is a Summer of Love". These Liberal Dems don’t have a clue. The terrorists burn and pillage our cities and they think it is just wonderful even the death. Must end this Seattle takeover now!
A sad day for the Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand has dropped out of the Presidential Primary. I’m glad they never found out that she was the one I was really afraid of!
Mail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!
New York City must stop the Shutdown now. The Governor & Mayor are destroying the place!
So after the Democrats gave me no Due Process in the House no lawyers no witnesses no nothing they now want to tell the Senate how to run their trial. Actually they have zero proof of anything they will never even show up. They want out. I want an immediate trial!
So horrible to watch the massive fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Perhaps flying water tankers could be used to put it out. Must act quickly!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
#StandForOurAnthem
I only signed the Defense Production Act to combat the Chinese Virus should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. Hopefully there will be no need but we are all in this TOGETHER!
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS!
Nancy just said she "just doesn’t understand why?" Very simply without a Wall it all doesn’t work. Our Country has a chance to greatly reduce Crime Human Trafficking Gangs and Drugs. Should have been done for decades. We will not Cave!
The issue of kneeling has nothing to do with race. It is about respect for our Country Flag and National Anthem. NFL must respect this!
So nice how well my State of the Union speech was received. Thank you to all!
Coronavirus numbers are looking MUCH better going down almost everywhere. Big progress being made!
Nancy Pelosi is looking for a Quid Pro Quo with the Senate. Why aren’t we Impeaching her?
Republicans will be providing far better Healthcare than the Democrats at a far lower cost...And will always protect people with Pre-existing conditions!!!!
The number of Coronavirus cases is strongly trending downward throughout the United States with few exceptions. Very good news indeed!
100% Republican Vote. That’s what people are talking about. The Republicans are united like never before!
....This will be remembered as one of the most shocking votes in the history of Congress. If there is one thing we should all agree on it’s protecting the lives of innocent babies.
80% of the RIOTERS in Minneapolis last night were from OUT OF STATE. They are harming businesses (especially African American small businesses) homes and the community of good hardworking Minneapolis residents who want peace equality and to provide for their families.
God Bless the people of Venezuela!
THE RIGGED AND CORRUPT MEDIA IS THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
Yesterday was a bad day for the Cuomo Brothers. New York was lost to the looters thugs Radical Left and all others forms of Lowlife & Scum. The Governor refuses to accept my offer of a dominating National Guard. NYC was ripped to pieces. Likewise Fredo’s ratings are down 50%!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
In the East it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record. Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country but not other countries was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against. Bundle up!
Let New York’s Finest be New York’s Finest. There is nobody better but they must be allowed to do their job!
अमेरिका और भारत अपने देशों को मजबूत बनाएँगे  अपने लोगों को सम्पन्न बनाएँगे बड़े सपने देखने वालों को और बड़ा बनाएँगे और अपना भविष्य पहले से कहीं अधिक उज्जवल बनाएँगे... और यह तो शुरुआत ही है।
The United States cannot have all Mail In Ballots. It will be the greatest Rigged Election in history. People grab them from mailboxes print thousands of forgeries and "force" people to sign. Also forge names. Some absentee OK when necessary. Trying to use Covid for this Scam!
I’m draining the Swamp and the Swamp is trying to fight back. Don’t worry we will win!
Everybody is so well unified and working so hard. It is a beautiful thing to see. They love our great Country. We will end up being stronger than ever before!
Does anyone notice how little the Radical Left takeover of Seattle is being discussed in the Fake News Media. That is very much on purpose because they know how badly this weakness & ineptitude play politically. The Mayor & Governor should be ashamed of themselves. Easily fixed!
MASSIVE REGULATION CUTS. VOTE!
The Democrats are holding back the $1200 to $3400 (family of four) checks that were ready to be sent out!
REVOKE 230!
We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks. "P Act" all the way. Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!
I have instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and he fully agrees not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the Country!
The Lamestream Media wants us to fail. That will NEVER happen!
Radical Left Democrats are going CRAZY!
Republicans get out and vote today for those great candidates that will lead to big victories on November 3rd. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL!
Rep. Tlaib wrote a letter to Israeli officials desperately wanting to visit her grandmother. Permission was quickly granted whereupon Tlaib obnoxiously turned the approval down a complete setup. The only real winner here is Tlaib’s grandmother. She doesn’t have to see her now!
Gas prices are low and expected to go down this year. This would be good!
Will be speaking at 7:00 P.M. Thank you for all of the nice comments on the Mount Rushmore speech last night!!!
Those Tweets were NOT Racist. I don’t have a Racist bone in my body! The so-called vote to be taken is a Democrat con game. Republicans should not show "weakness" and fall into their trap. This should be a vote on the filthy language statements and lies told by the Democrat.....
We will miss GREAT Country Rocker Charlie Daniels who passed away yesterday in Hermitage Tennessee. My condolences to his wife Hazel and their family. Charlie is in my thoughts and prayers. I love his music! #RIPCharlieDaniels
So much of the Lamestream Media is writing and broadcasting stories with facts that are made up and knowingly wrong. They are doing it by quoting unnamed sources that simply do not exist. These are very dangerous & corrupt people who will do anything to win. NAME YOUR SOURCES!
Congratulations to Boris Johnson on his great WIN! Britain and the United States will now be free to strike a massive new Trade Deal after BREXIT. This deal has the potential to be far bigger and more lucrative than any deal that could be made with the E.U. Celebrate Boris!
Nancy Pelosi is asking for $2.4 Trillion Dollars to bailout poorly run high crime Democrat States money that is in no way related to COVID-19. We made a very generous offer of $1.6 Trillion Dollars and as usual she is not negotiating in good faith. I am rejecting their...
Biden was asked questions at his so-called Press Conference yesterday where he read the answers from a teleprompter. That means he was given the questions just like Crooked Hillary. Never have seen this before!
A perfectly executed strike last night. Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military. Could not have had a better result. Mission Accomplished!
I hope everyone is having a great Christmas then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)!
Very proud of the U.S. Senate for voting "YES" to advance the nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh!
Our economy is better than it has been in many decades. Businesses are coming back to America like never before. Chrysler as an example is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA. Unemployment is nearing record lows. We are on the right track!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and then KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!
Crazy Nancy Pelosi said I made a mistake when I banned people from infected China from entering the U.S. in January. Tens of thousands of lives were saved as she danced in the Streets of Chinatown (SF) in late February. Biden agreed with her but soon admitted that I was right!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
I am continuing to monitor the censorship of AMERICAN CITIZENS on social media platforms. This is the United States of America — and we have what’s known as FREEDOM OF SPEECH! We are monitoring and watching closely!!
BEST V.A. EVER. 91% APPROVAL RATING. VOTE!
Courageous Patriots have fought and died for our great American Flag --- we MUST honor and respect it!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
My use of social media is not Presidential - it’s MODERN DAY PRESIDENTIAL. Make America Great Again!
They are sending out 51000000 Ballots to people who haven’t even requested a Ballot. Many of those people don’t even exist. They are trying to STEAL this election. This should not be allowed!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Absentee Ballots are a great way to vote for the many senior citizens military and others who can’t get to the polls on Election Day. These ballots are very different from 100% Mail-In Voting which is "RIPE for FRAUD" and shouldn’t be allowed!
I will be lowering the flags on all Federal Buildings and National Monuments to half-staff over the next three days in memory of the Americans we have lost to the CoronaVirus....
Germany pays Russia billions of dollars a year for Energy and we are supposed to protect Germany from Russia. What’s that all about? Also Germany is very delinquent in their 2% fee to NATO. We are therefore moving some troops out of Germany!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
BEST USA ECONOMY IN HISTORY!
Had failed presidential candidate @MittRomney devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering Barack Obama as he sanctimoniously does to me he could have won the election. Read the Transcripts!
This is a battle to save the Heritage History and Greatness of our Country! #MAGA2020
Here we go again. Fake News @CNN is blaming RUSSIA RUSSIA RUSSIA. They are sick losers with VERY bad ratings! P.S. Can’t blame China because they need the cash?
Vaccines are moving along fast and safely!
Cuomo’s been calling daily even hourly begging for everything most of which should have been the state’s responsibility such as new hospitals beds ventilators etc. I got it all done for him and everyone else and now he seems to want Independence! That won’t happen!
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer just said "The American people want a fair trial in the Senate." True but why didn’t Nervous Nancy and Corrupt politician Adam "Shifty" Schiff give us a fair trial in the House. It was the most lopsided & unfair basement hearing in the history of Congress!
Republicans had a deal until Nancy Pelosi rode into town from her extended vacation. The Democrats want the Virus to win? They are asking for things that have nothing to do with our great workers or companies. They want Open Borders & Green New Deal. Republicans shouldn’t agree!
We are having very productive calls with the leaders of every sector of the economy who are all-in on getting America back to work and soon. More to come! #MAGA
Sleepy Joe Biden is just a Trojan Horse for the Radical Left Agenda. He will do whatever they want!
Praying for the two police officers that were shot tonight in Louisville Kentucky. The Federal Government stands behind you and is ready to help. Spoke to @GovAndyBeshear and we are prepared to work together immediately upon request!
Kathy Griffin should be ashamed of herself. My children especially my 11 year old son Barron are having a hard time with this. Sick!
Just left hospital. Rep. Steve Scalise one of the truly great people is in very tough shape - but he is a real fighter. Pray for Steve!
We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Getting ready to land in Macon Georgia. Another giant crowd. See you soon!
Did you hear the latest con job? President Obama is now trying to take credit for the Economic Boom taking place under the Trump Administration. He had the WEAKEST recovery since the Great Depression despite Zero Fed Rate & MASSIVE quantitative easing. NOW best jobs numbers....
I am monitoring the situation in Venezuela very closely. The United States stands with the People of Venezuela and their Freedom!
LIBERATE VIRGINIA and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!
My friend (always there when I’ve needed him!) Senator @RandPaul was just tested "positive" from the Chinese Virus. That is not good! He is strong and will get better. Just spoke to him and he was in good spirits.
Today Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to by me as Pocahontas joined the race for President. Will she run as our first Native American presidential candidate or has she decided that after 32 years this is not playing so well anymore? See you on the campaign TRAIL Liz!
No Radical Left anarchists agitators looters or protesters will not be knocking down or harming the Washington Monument the Lincoln or Jefferson Memorials or just about any other Federal Monumrnt or Statue. If they even try an automatic 10 years in prison. Sorry!
The Democrats and President Obama gave Iran 150 Billion Dollars and got nothing but they can’t give 5 Billion Dollars for National Security and a Wall?
Asian Americans are VERY angry at what China has done to our Country and the World. Chinese Americans are the most angry of all. I don’t blame them!
Getting ready to go to the Daytona 500. Will be GREAT!
Governor should call in the National Guard in Wisconsin. It is ready willing and more than able. End problem FAST!
I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern.
....hundreds of Iranian protesters. He was already attacking our Embassy and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years. Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets we have.....
Oh no Beto just dropped out of race for President despite him saying he was "born for this." I don’t think so!
There has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have. The Democrats are frozen with hatred and fear. They get nothing done. This should never be allowed to happen to another President. Witch Hunt!
The Radical Left Democrats new theme is "Defund the Police". Remember that when you don’t want Crime especially against you and your family. This is where Sleepy Joe is being dragged by the socialists. I am the complete opposite more money for Law Enforcement! #LAWANDORDER
DRAIN THE SWAMP!
....BUT THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
When the so-called "rich guys" speak negatively about the market you must always remember that some are betting big against it and make a lot of money if it goes down. Then they go positive get big publicity and make it going up. They get you both ways. Barely legal?
Nancy Pelosi just had a nervous fit. She hates that we will soon have 182 great new judges and sooo much more. Stock Market and employment records. She says she "prays for the President." I don’t believe her not even close. Help the homeless in your district Nancy. USMCA?
Our Economy and Jobs are doing really well. Next Year will be a Record Setter. Stay Tuned!
No president ever worked harder than me (cleaning up the mess I inherited)!
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS! Get ready it is already happening again!
Never in history have Police been treated so badly as they are in Democrat run cities - and these cities are a mess. Police must take a stronger stand with the Radical Left politicians that are treating them so badly and so disrespectfully!!!
Numerous people arrested in D.C. for the disgraceful vandalism in Lafayette Park of the magnificent Statue of Andrew Jackson in addition to the exterior defacing of St. John’s Church across the street. 10 years in prison under the Veteran’s Memorial Preservation Act. Beware!
Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the congregation of yesterday’s church attack. It was over in 6 seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect 242 fellow worshippers. Lives were saved by these heroes and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!
Nancy Pelosi needs help fast! There is either something wrong with her "upstairs" or she just plain doesn’t like our great Country. She had a total meltdown in the White House today. It was very sad to watch. Pray for her she is a very sick person!
God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you.
100000 DEFECTIVE BALLOTS IN NEW YORK. THEY WANT TO REPLACE THEM BUT WHERE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THE BALLOTS THAT WERE FIRST SENT? THEY WILL BE USED BY SOMEBODY. USA END THIS SCAM - GO OUT AND VOTE!
To all of the great people who are working so hard for your Country and not getting paid I say THANK YOU - YOU ARE GREAT PATRIOTS! We must now work together after decades of abuse to finally fix the Humanitarian Criminal & Drug Crisis at our Border. WE WILL WIN BIG!
I was saddened to learn of the passing of India's former President Pranab Mukherjee. I send my condolences to his family and the people of India as they grieve the loss of a great leader.
No matter what you give to the Democrats in the end they will NEVER be satisfied. In the House they gave us NOTHING!
The D.C. Police are not doing their job as they watch a statue be ripped down & burn. These people should be immediately arrested. A disgrace to our Country!  @MayorBowser
STOCK MARKET UP BIG!
Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats delayed the Workers Help/Stimulus Bill by over a week trying to add real "junk" into the Bill. Got some bad things having nothing to do with those affected by the Virus included. Republicans need their votes until we WIN BACK THE HOUSE IN 2020!
Doing REALLY well medically on solving the CoronaVirus situation (Plague!). It will happen!
Just like I was right on Ventilators (our Country is now the "King of Ventilators" other countries are calling asking for help-we will!) I am right on testing. Governors must be able to step up and get the job done. We will be with you ALL THE WAY!
My Administration will do everything in its power to prevent weak mayors and lawless cities from taking Federal dollars while they let anarchists harm people burn buildings and ruin lives and businesses. We’re putting them on notice today. @RussVought45
NASDAQ HITS ALL TIME HIGH!
Great news! American families will now be able to buy safer more affordable and environmentally friendly cars with our new SAFE VEHICLES RULE. Get rid of those old unsafe clunkers. Build better and safer American cars and create American jobs. Buy American!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Being nice to Rocket Man hasn't worked in 25 years why would it work now? Clinton failed Bush failed and Obama failed. I won't fail.
Big WIN in Texas on Mail-In Ballots!
Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis the world’s most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation & felt great about it. His nickname was "Chaos" which I didn’t like & changed to "Mad Dog"...
....I have been packed all day with meetings I have no time for stupidity. We’re working around the clock to KEEP AMERICA SAFE!
May God be w/ the people of Sutherland Springs Texas. The FBI & law enforcement are on the scene. I am monitoring the situation from Japan.
CNN’s Don Lemon the dumbest man on television insinuated last night while asking a debate "question" that I was a racist when in fact I am "the least racist person in the world." Perhaps someone should explain to Don that he is supposed to be neutral unbiased & fair.....
....it is done. These places need your help badly you can’t leave fast enough. I’m sure that Nancy Pelosi would be very happy to quickly work out free travel arrangements!
It’s never a real Twitter Trending. It’s Twitter Executive’s Choice. Only negative on Republican voices especially mine!
I don't know Putin have no deals in Russia and the haters are going crazy - yet Obama can make a deal with Iran #1 in terror no problem!
Radical Left Governor @JayInslee and the Mayor of Seattle are being taunted and played at a level that our great Country has never seen before. Take back your city NOW. If you don’t do it I will. This is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stooped IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!
Can you believe that I had to go through the worst and most corrupt political Witch Hunt in the history of the United States (No Collusion) when it was the "other side" that illegally created the diversionary & criminal event and even spied on my campaign? Disgraceful!
NASDAQ HITS ALL-TIME HIGH!
Corrupt Joe Biden and the Democrats don’t want to open schools in the Fall for political reasons not for health reasons! They think it will help them in November. Wrong the people get it!
There are now 77 major or significant Walls built around the world with 45 countries planning or building Walls. Over 800 miles of Walls have been built in Europe since only 2015. They have all been recognized as close to 100% successful. Stop the crime at our Southern Border!
Crazy Nancy Pelosi said she was "set up" by the beauty parlor owner when she improperly had the salon opened (and didn’t wear a MASK!). Does anyone want a Speaker of the House who can be so easily SET UP?
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS
REPEAL SECTION 230!!!
Great Jobs Numbers! 1.37 Million Jobs Added In August. Unemployment Rate Falls To 8.4% (Wow much better than expected!). Broke the 10% level faster and deeper than thought possible.
The New York Times is an embarrassment to journalism. They were a dead paper before I went into politics and they will be a dead paper after I leave which will be in 5 years. Fake News is the Enemy of the people!
Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden. Really is something - SPECIAL COUNTRY SPECIAL PLACE!
Documents reveal that General Flynn was entrapped! @EveningEdit @FoxNews
Happy Easter to everyone!
I must say that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. That’s what they ALL said 4 years ago and nothing happened in fact I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting but they will. Be careful!
If I were a Senator or Congressman the first person I would call to testify about the biggest political crime and scandal in the history of the USA by FAR is former President Obama. He knew EVERYTHING. Do it @LindseyGrahamSC just do it. No more Mr. Nice Guy. No more talk!
I am deeply saddened by the tragic loss of eight Marines and one Sailor during a training exercise off the coast of California. Our prayers are with their families. I thank them for the brave service their loved ones gave to our Nation. #SemperFidelis
On behalf of the United States congratulations to the Thai Navy SEALs and all on the successful rescue of the 12 boys and their coach from the treacherous cave in Thailand. Such a beautiful moment - all freed great job!
HIGHEST CABLE TELEVISION RATINGS OF ALL TIME. SECOND HIGHEST OVERALL TELEVISION RATINGS OF ALL TIME. Some day these Fake Media Companies are going to miss me very badly!!!
Facebook has just stated that they are setting up a system to "purge" themselves of Fake News. Does that mean CNN will finally be put out of business?
I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health. Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks! Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope!
Making Daylight Saving Time permanent is O.K. with me!
...TODAY I will be sending federal law enforcement and the National Guard to Kenosha WI to restore LAW and ORDER!
"I’m voting for Donald Trump. My father is a Union Worker and his 401K has tripled under President Trump." USA Voter. @foxandfriends  Thank you and remember that the Stock Market is getting ready to break its all time high. NEXT YEAR WILL BE THE BEST EVER. VOTE VOTE VOTE!!!!!
The Obama/Biden Administration is the most corrupt Administration in the history of our Country!
Social Media Giants are silencing millions of people. Can’t do this even if it means we must continue to hear Fake News like CNN whose ratings have suffered gravely. People have to figure out what is real and what is not without censorship!
If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFLor other leagues he or she should not be allowed to disrespect....
BIGGEST STOCK MARKET RISE IN HISTORY YESTERDAY!
Disgraceful that Big Ten is not playing football. Let them PLAY!
AMERICA FIRST!
We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute. Thank you!
As the President of the United States I have an absolute right perhaps even a duty to investigate or have investigated CORRUPTION and that would include asking or suggesting other Countries to help us out!
Just spoke to Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali of Ethiopia. His Country needs Ventilators and the U.S. is in good position to help him. We will!
Democrats just blocked @FoxNews from holding a debate. Good then I think I’ll do the same thing with the Fake News Networks and the Radical Left Democrats in the General Election debates!
As I have said for a long time dealing with China is a very expensive thing to do. We just made a great Trade Deal the ink was barely dry and the World was hit by the Plague from China. 100 Trade Deals wouldn’t make up the difference - and all those innocent lives lost!
.@OANN  A key CoronaVirus Model is now predicting far fewer deaths than the number shown in earlier models. That’s because the American people are doing a great job. Social Distancing etc. Keep going!
Despite biggest ever job gains and a V shaped recovery Joe Biden said "I would shut it down" referring to our Country. He has no clue!
There is nothing racist in stating plainly what most people already know that Elijah Cummings has done a terrible job for the people of his district and of Baltimore itself. Dems always play the race card when they are unable to win with facts. Shame!
Every time you see a negative Big Pharma commercial against me remember it means your drug prices are coming way down!
Congressman Adam Schiff who spent two years knowingly and unlawfully lying and leaking should be forced to resign from Congress!
NASDAQ HITS ALL-TIME HIGH. Tremendous progress being made way ahead of schedule. USA!
I am in the Oval Office & just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas. We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of Dollars & lives will be saved!
I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security. At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!
Anarchists just took over Seattle and the Liberal Democrat Governor just said he knows "nothing about that".
Congratulations to @TigerWoods. a truly Great Champion!
Big Tech is doing everything in their very considerable power to CENSOR in advance of the 2020 Election. If that happens we no longer have our freedom. I will never let it happen! They tried hard in 2016 and lost. Now they are going absolutely CRAZY. Stay Tuned!!!
Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia. That’s what happens when you vote for Democrats they will take your guns away. Republicans will win Virginia in 2020. Thank you Dems!
2016 was AMAZING but we never had this kind of ENTHUSIASM!
The Obama Administration was not out to get the facts they were out to "get Trump". Ken Starr...And got caught red handed - All of them. "Trump was right" they said!
سه نفر در ایران برای شرکت کردن در تظاهرات محکوم به مرگ شده اند. اعدام آنها در هر لحظه قابل انتظار است. اعدام این سه نفر پیامی اسفناک به دنیا می فرستد و نباید انجام شود. #اعدام_نکنید
The Greatest Witch Hunt In American History!
Cuomo wants "all states to be treated the same." But all states aren’t the same. Some are being hit hard by the Chinese Virus some are being hit practically not at all. New York is a very big "hotspot" West Virginia has thus far zero cases. Andrew keep politics out of it....
"Newly released documents show Schiff knew all along there was no proof of Russia-Trump collusion." Wall Street Journal
Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!
National Security Adviser suggested today that sanctions & protests have Iran "choked off" will force them to negotiate. Actually I couldn’t care less if they negotiate. Will be totally up to them but no nuclear weapons and "don’t kill your protesters."
Other Democrat run Cities and States should look at the total shutdown of Radical Left Anarchists in Minneapolis last night. The National Guard did a great job and should be used in other States before it is too late!
The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats keep chanting "fairness" when they put on the most unfair Witch Hunt in the history of the U.S. Congress. They had 17 Witnesses we were allowed ZERO and no lawyers. They didn’t do their job had no case. The Dems are scamming America!
New documents just released reveal General Flynn was telling the truth and the FBI knew it! @OANN
If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!
Inconceivable that the government would break into a lawyer’s office (early in the morning) - almost unheard of. Even more inconceivable that a lawyer would tape a client - totally unheard of & perhaps illegal. The good news is that your favorite President did nothing wrong!
I will never let our Post Office fail. It has been mismanaged for years especially since the advent of the internet and modern-day technology. The people that work there are great and we’re going to keep them happy healthy and well!
Obama worked harder for Hillary Clinton and the losing Clinton Campaign than she worked for herself! Now he’s working with Sleepy Joe - will be same result. MAGA is energized like never before!
I disagree with @CDCgov on their very tough & expensive guidelines for opening schools. While they want them open they are asking schools to do very impractical things. I will be meeting with them!!!
....big fat waste of time energy and money - $30000000 to be exact. It is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes perhaps even Spying or Treason. This should never happen again!
ISIS is in retreat our economy is booming investments and jobs are pouring back into the country and so much more! Together there is nothing we can’t overcome--even a very biased media. We ARE Making America Great Again!
Crazy Nancy Pelosi and the Radical Left Democrats were just playing "games" with the desperately needed Workers Stimulus Payments.They just wanted to take care of Democrat failed high crime Cities and States. They were never in it to help the workers and they never will be!
Just signed a new Executive Order to LOWER DRUG PRICES! My Most Favored Nation order will ensure that our Country gets the same low price Big Pharma gives to other countries. The days of global freeriding at America’s expense are over...
The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don’t fall for it! Also look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love! #Troublemakers
Getting ready to speak in Florida. Enjoy!
Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border. The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked. If stalemate continues Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real long term budget no C.R.’s!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
"I don’t see any indication that there were any white supremest groups mixing in. This is an ANTIFA Organization. It seems that the first time we saw it in a major way was Occupy Wall Street. It’s the same mindset." @kilmeade  @foxandfriends  TRUE!
Must know Election results on the night of the Election not days months or even years later!
Governors Andrew Cuomo of New York has the worst record on death and China Virus. 11000 people alone died in Nursing Homes because of his incompetence!
The most often used phrase in the Lamestream Media by far is "sources say" or "officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity" or anything similar which allows Fake News to make up a phony quote from a person who doesn’t even exist. The American people should demand NAMES!
Twitter makes sure that Trending on Twitter is anything bad Fake or not about President Donald Trump. So obvious what they are doing. Being studied now!
Another great day for peace with Middle East – Muslim-majority Kosovo and Israel have agreed to normalize ties and establish diplomatic relations. Well-done! More Islamic and Arab nations will follow soon!
The so-called "Supreme Leader" of Iran who has not been so Supreme lately had some nasty things to say about the United States and Europe. Their economy is crashing and their people are suffering. He should be very careful with his words!
If the Democrats think they are going to waste Taxpayer Money investigating us at the House level then we will likewise be forced to consider investigating them for all of the leaks of Classified Information and much else at the Senate level. Two can play that game!
Major News Conference tonight the White House at 6:00 P.M. (Eastern) to explain Guidelines for OPENING UP AMERICA AGAIN!
Blame the Democrats for any "lateness" in your Enhanced Unemployment Insurance. I wanted the money to be paid directly they insisted it be paid by states for distribution. I told them this would happen especially with many states which have old computers.
MSDNC and FAKE NEWS CNN are going wild trying to protect China!
Big Pharma is taking television ads trying to make the case that I am raising prescription drug prices on seniors. The ad is a lie! What I have done will lead to a 50% REDUCTION in prices at least & Big Pharma is not happy about it. No other President would....
Actually I think I’m leading in the Polls!  @FoxNews @OANN
Just finished reading my son Donald’s just out new book "Triggered." It is really good! He along with many of us was very unfairly treated. But we all fight back and we always win!
.@FoxNews "Dems say President Trump is trying to open the United States Economy too quickly" but if I took even a little more time they would loudly chant that I am moving too slowly. Just political talking points for them. For me it’s about lives &  the future of our Country!
Congratulations to Prime Minister Abe of Japan and the IOC on their very wise decision to present the Olympics in 2021. It will be a great success and I look forward to being there!
Unemployment Rate just dropped to 3.5% the lowest in more that 50 years. Is that an impeachable event for your President?
When a car is sent to the United States from China there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade.  No it sounds like STUPID TRADE -  going on for years!
Good news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville Alabama plant which will produce over 300000 cars and SUV’s a year and employ 4000 people. Companies are coming back to the U.S. in a very big way. Congratulations Alabama!
I know it is not at all "Presidential" to hit back at the Corrupt Media or people who work for the Corrupt Media when they make false statements about me or the Trump Administration. Problem is if you don’t hit back people believe the Fake News is true. So we’ll hit back!
How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? WITCH-HUNT!
Just spoke with President @JairBolsonaro of Brazil. Our future Trade prospects are very exciting and our relationship is strong perhaps stronger than ever before. I told him if the United States can help with the Amazon Rainforest fires we stand ready to assist!
READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!
So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs and obviously want back in. Sad!
"In America if you hate our Country you are free to leave. The simple fact of the matter is the four Congresswomen think that America is wicked in its origins they think that America is even more wicked now that we are all racist and evil. They’re entitled to their.....
I have offered DACA a wonderful deal including a doubling in the number of recipients & a twelve year pathway to citizenship for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem. (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA only use it!
Sorry to inform the Do Nothing Democrats but I am getting VERY GOOD internal Polling Numbers. Just like 2016 the @nytimes Polls are Fake! The @FoxNews Polls are a JOKE! Do you think they will apologize to me & their subscribers AGAIN when I WIN? People want LAW ORDER & SAFETY!
Here we go with Mitt Romney but so fast! Question will be is he a Flake?  I hope not. Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big and he didn’t. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!
With interest rates for the United States being at ZERO this is the time to do our decades long awaited Infrastructure Bill. It should be VERY BIG & BOLD Two Trillion Dollars and be focused solely on jobs and rebuilding the once great infrastructure of our Country! Phase 4
LIBERATE MINNESOTA!
We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers drug dealers  and other violent criminal elements. They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country NOW! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
I won an election said to be one of the greatest of all time based on getting out of endless & costly foreign wars & also based on Strong Borders which will keep our Country safe. We fight for the borders of other countries but we won’t fight for the borders of our own!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Why is it that China for decades and with a population much bigger than ours is paying a tiny fraction of $’s to The World Health Organization The United Nations and worst of all The World Trade Organization where they are considered a so-called "developing country" and...
I will be signing my Executive Order prohibiting immigration into our Country today. In the meantime even without this order our Southern Border aided substantially by the 170 miles of new Border Wall & 27000 Mexican soldiers is very tight - including for human trafficking!
There is a rise in Coronavirus cases because our testing is so massive and so good far bigger and better than any other country. This is great news but even better news is that death and the death rate is DOWN. Also younger people who get better much easier and faster!
Cases up because of BIG Testing! Much of our Country is doing very well. Open the Schools!
Virginia Voters! Your Governor wants to obliterate your Second Amendment. I have stopped him. I am the only thing between you and your Second Amendment. Working hard in Virginia. It’s IN PLAY. Better Vote for your favorite President or wave goodbye to low taxes and gun rights!
Twitter should let the banned Conservative Voices back onto their platform without restriction. It’s called Freedom of Speech remember. You are making a Giant Mistake!
My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting. No child teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school.
One of the greats in the history of television Regis Philbin has passed on to even greater airwaves at 88. He was a fantastic person and my friend. He kept telling me to run for President. Holds the record for "most live television" and he did it well. Regis we love you....
Pelosi wants to take 30 Billion Dollars away from our great Farmers. Can’t let that happen!
Georgia this is your chance to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. We have been strong for our Military Vets 2nd Amendment and ALL. VOTE NOW!
Mexico should move the flag waving Migrants many of whom are stone cold criminals back to their countries. Do it by plane do it by bus do it anyway you want but they are NOT coming into the U.S.A. We will close the Border permanently if need be. Congress fund the WALL!
Where is the 302? It is missing. Was it stolen or destroyed? General Flynn is being persecuted! #OBAMAGATE
We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth - and we will bring back our dreams!
California and New York must do something about their TREMENDOUS Homeless problems. They are setting records! If their Governors can’t handle the situation which they should be able to do very easily they must call and "politely" ask for help. Would be so easy with competence!
Today’s shooting in El Paso Texas was not only tragic it was an act of cowardice. I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn today’s hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people....
NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room. He killed 8 people badly injured 12. SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!
....We no longer pay Pakistan the $Billions because they would take our money and do nothing for us Bin Laden being a prime example Afghanistan being another. They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return. That’s ENDING!
If you don’t have Borders you don’t have a Country!
MEXICO HAS AGREED TO IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BUYING LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCT FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS!
Tell the Dems that we have more Cases because we do FAR more Testing than any other Country!
Today I spoke with American physicians and nurses to thank them for their tireless work. Doctors and nurses are at the front lines of this war and are true American HEROES! With their help America will WIN.
When you see the Drug Companies taking massive  television ads against me forget what they say (which is false) YOU KNOW THAT DRUG PRICES ARE COMING DOWN BIG. Favored Nations Clause means USA will pay the lowest price of any nation in the World. Never done before. Watch!!!
Everybody is asking how the phony and fraudulent investigation of the No Collusion No Obstruction Trump Campaign began. We need to know for future generations to understand. This Hoax should never be allowed to happen to another President or Administration again!
TRANSITION TO GREATNESS
Market up big today on very good economic news. JOBS JOBS JOBS!
Pelosi and Schumer only interested in Bailout Money for poorly run Democrat cities and states. Nothing to do with China Virus! Want one trillion dollars. No interest. We are going a different way!
The 2020 Election will be totally rigged if Mail-In Voting is allowed to take place & everyone knows it. So much time is taken talking about foreign influence but the same people won’t even discuss Mail-In election corruption. Look at Patterson N.J. 20% of vote was corrupted!
The Do Nothing Democrats should be focused on building up our Country not wasting everyone’s time and energy on BULLSHIT which is what they have been doing ever since I got overwhelmingly elected in 2016 223-306. Get a better candidate this time you’ll need it!
Fake News is truly the ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
I have done more for WOMEN than just about any President in HISTORY! As we celebrate the 100th Anniversary of women’s voting rights we should build a BEAUTIFUL STATUE in Washington D.C. to honor the many brave women who made this possible for our GREAT COUNTRY...
Really Big Breaking News (Kidding): Booker who was in zero polling territory just dropped out of the Democrat Presidential Primary Race. Now I can rest easy tonight. I was sooo concerned that I would someday have to go head to head with him!
Amazingly CNN just released a poll at 71% saying that the economy is in the best shape since 2001 18 years! WOW is CNN becoming a believer?
Pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the U.S. Congress and now she is crying for fairness in the Senate and breaking all rules while doing so. She lost Congress once she will do it again!
Now Mini Mike Bloomberg is critical of Jack Wilson who saved perhaps hundreds of people in a Church because he was carrying a gun and knew how to use it. Jack quickly killed the shooter who was beginning a rampage. Mini is against the 2nd A. His ads are Fake just like him!
Oil prices moving up nicely as demand begins again!
STOCK MARKET AT ALL-TIME HIGH! HOW ARE YOUR 401K’S DOING? 70% 80% 90% up? Only 50% up! What are you doing wrong?
How does Da Nang Dick (Blumenthal) serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee when he defrauded the American people about his so called War Hero status in Vietnam only to later admit with tears pouring down his face that he was never in Vietnam. An embarrassment to our Country!
Why is so much money sent to the Elijah Cummings district when it is considered the worst run and most dangerous anywhere in the United States. No human being would want to live there. Where is all this money going? How much is stolen? Investigate this corrupt mess immediately!
Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren other than Mini Mike was the loser of the night. She didn’t even come close to winning her home state of Massachusetts. Well now she can just sit back with her husband and have a nice cold beer!
Anybody entering the United States illegally will be arrested and detained prior to being sent back to their country!
.....Be happy be cool! A football game that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy is no place to protest. Most of that money goes to the players anyway. Find another way to protest. Stand proudly for your National Anthem or be Suspended Without Pay!
Pelosi feels her phony impeachment HOAX is so pathetic she is afraid to present it to the Senate which can set a date and put this whole SCAM into default if they refuse to show up! The Do Nothings are so bad for our Country!
Our great National Guard Troops who took care of the area around the White House could hardly believe how easy it was. "A walk in the park" one said. The protesters agitators anarchists (ANTIFA) and others were handled VERY easily by the Guard D.C. Police & S.S. GREAT JOB!
Nissan is rolling out it’s 2021 ROGUE from TENNESSEE. Great!
As I learn more and more each day I am coming to the conclusion that what is taking place is not an impeachment it is a COUP intended to take away the Power of the....
Two Democrat Caucus Meetings removed "UNDER GOD" from the Pledge of Allegiance. It sounded not only strange but terrible. That’s where they’re coming from!
Florida looking good!
Just arrived in Vietnam. Thank you to all of the people for the great reception in Hanoi. Tremendous crowds and so much love!
You just can’t win with the Fake News Media. A big story today is that because I have pushed so hard and gotten Gasoline Prices so low more people are driving and I have caused traffic jams throughout our Great Nation. Sorry everyone!
VETO!
THE ONLY REASON TO VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT IS IF YOU’RE TIRED OF WINNING!
Never has the press been more inaccurate unfair or corrupt! We are not fighting the Democrats they are easy we are fighting the seriously dishonest and unhinged Lamestream Media. They have gone totally CRAZY. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
So now Crooked Hillary is at it again! She is calling Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard "a Russian favorite" and Jill Stein "a Russian asset." As you may have heard I was called a big Russia lover also (actually I do like Russian people. I like all people!). Hillary’s gone Crazy!
Democrats want to Defund & Abolish Police. This despite poor crime numbers in cities that they run. CRAZY!
If you want to get money into the hands of people quickly & efficiently let them have the full money that they earned APPROVE A PAYROLL TAX CUT until the end of the year December 31. Then you are doing something that is really meaningful. Only that will make a big difference!
3.1 GDP FOR THE YEAR BEST NUMBER IN 14 YEARS!
Vaccines are coming along really well. Likewise therapeutics. Moving faster than anticipated. Good news ahead (in many ways)!
We’ve got NASA "rocking" again. Great activity and success. Congrats to SPACEX and all!
Illinois has no place to go. Sad isn’t it? Vote Trump!
"(Crooked) Hillary Clinton confirms she will not run in 2020 rules out a third bid for White House." Aw-shucks does that mean I won’t get to run against her again? She will be sorely missed!
Democrats OPEN THE SCHOOLS ( SAFELY) NOW! When schools are closed let the money follow the child (FAMILY). Why should schools be paid when they are closed? They shouldn’t!
Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration. Can’t let that happen!
.....This action is taken effective immediately but may also be used retroactively for destruction or vandalism already caused. There will be no exceptions!
As I have stated many times if the Democrats take over the House or Senate there will be disruption to the Financial Markets. We won the Senate they won the House. Things will settle down. They only want to impeach me because they know they can’t win in 2020 too much success!
Payroll Tax Cut plus Dollars!
HAPPY VETERANS DAY!
Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? That's because they used knives and a truck!
Heading to Toledo Ohio for first Rally of the year. Tremendous crowd. Here we go for a big 2020 Win!
Breaking News: Unemployment Rate at 3.5% drops to a 50 YEAR LOW. Wow America lets impeach your President (even though he did nothing wrong!).
So ridiculous to see Twitter trying to make the case that Mail-In Ballots are not subject to FRAUD. How stupid there are examples & cases all over the place. Our election process will become badly tainted & a laughingstock all over the World. Tell that to your hater @yoyoel
Leaving now for Florida Rally. Big crowds!
Stock Markets (all three) hit another ALL TIME & HISTORIC HIGH yesterday! You are sooo lucky to have me as your President (just kidding!). Spend your money well!
Nobody wants Sleepy Joe as a leader including the Radical Left (which he lost last night!). He disrespected Bernie effectively calling him a loser!
....I am doing exactly what I pledged to do and what I was elected to do by the citizens of our great Country. Just as I promised I am fighting for YOU!
Many people are saying that the Mainstream Media will have a very hard time restoring credibility because of the way they have treated me over the past 3 years (including the election lead-up) as highlighted by the disgraceful Buzzfeed story & the even more disgraceful coverage!
Democrats Hate that I called for Big Pharma to match the lowest prescription drug prices in the World by using a FAVORED NATIONS CLAUSE. Prices will plunge!
So sad to see the Democrats sticking up for people who speak so badly of our Country and who in addition hate Israel with a true and unbridled passion. Whenever confronted they call their adversaries including Nancy Pelosi "RACIST." Their disgusting language.....
Big day for Israel. Congratulations!
The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster. Nothing works just like they ran the Country. Remember the  5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is "Trump".
.....Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!
WHY DID HE REFUSE TO ENDORSE SLOW JOE UNTIL IT WAS ALL OVER AND EVEN THEN WAS VERY LATE? WHY DID HE TRY TO GET HIM NOT TO RUN?
Because of MAIL-IN BALLOTS 2020 will be the most RIGGED Election in our nations history - unless this stupidity is ended. We voted during World War One & World War Two with no problem but now they are using Covid in order to cheat by using Mail-Ins!
Sleepy Joe Biden just closed down his campaign for the day (Again). Wants to rest! He is a very LOW ENERGY INDIVIDUAL and our Country cannot make it in these exciting but complex and competitive times with a Low Energy President !!!
Our Country wants to move safely forward. There is a tremendous pent up demand. We will open big!
We have now Tested more than 5 Million People. That is more than any other country in the World and even more than  all major countries combined!
Happy Father’s Day to all including my worst and most vicious critics of which there are fewer and fewer. This is a FANTASTIC time to be an American! KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
When we win I as your President will totally forgive ALL deferred payroll taxes with money from the General Fund. I will ALWAYS protect Seniors and your Social Security! Sleepy Joe Biden will do the opposite he will raise your taxes and DESTROY our Country!
Didn’t Obama whose Administration has now been caught cold illegally spying on the Trump campaign recently also get caught playing golf on a course in Virginia despite his wife Michelle urging people to stay home before and after his round in a major public service message?
....Many of the top FBI brass were fired forced to leave or left. McCabe’s wife received BIG DOLLARS from Clinton people for her campaign - he gave Hillary a pass. McCabe is a disgrace to the FBI and a disgrace to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Time Magazine called to say that I was PROBABLY going to be named "Man (Person) of the Year" like last year but I would have to agree to an interview and a major photo shoot. I said probably is no good and took a pass. Thanks anyway!
Just out: The USA has the absolute legal right to have apprehended illegal immigrants transferred to Sanctuary Cities. We hereby demand that they be taken care of at the highest level especially by the State of California which is well known or its poor management & high taxes!
Crazy Bernie has just entered the race. I wish him well!
Big Congressional win in California for Mike Garcia taking back a seat from the Democrats. This is the first time in many years that a California Dem seat has flipped back to a Republican. Also Tom Tiffany beat his Democrat rival BIG in Wisconsin. Two great Congressional WINS!
Major News Conference in Ten Minutes!
Looking like Nick Sandman & Covington Catholic students were treated unfairly with early judgements proving out to be false - smeared by media. Not good but making big comeback! "New footage shows that media was wrong about teen’s encounter with Native American" @TuckerCarlson
Just had a very good call with @SwedishPM Stefan Löfven who assured me that American citizen A$AP Rocky will be treated fairly. Likewise I assured him that A$AP was not a flight risk and offered to personally vouch for his bail or an alternative....
The big Oil Deal with OPEC Plus is done. This will save hundreds of thousands of energy jobs in the United States. I would like to thank and congratulate President Putin of Russia and King Salman of Saudi Arabia. I just spoke to them from the Oval Office. Great deal for all!
Last night I was so proud to have signed the largest Defense Bill ever. The very vital Space Force was created. New planes ships missiles rockets and equipment of every kind and all made right here in the USA. Additionally we got Border Wall (being built) funding. Nice!
Russian Billionaire wired Hunter Biden 3 1/2 Million Dollars. This on top of all of the other money he received while Joe was V.P. Crooked as can be but Fake Mainstream Media wants it to just go away!
A big salute to Jerry Jones owner of the Dallas Cowboys who will BENCH players who disrespect our Flag."Stand for Anthem or sit for game!"
Just out — in Arizona SIGNATURES DON’T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy!
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
Republican Approval Rating = 95%. Thank you!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Congratulations to JPMorgan Chase for ordering everyone BACK TO OFFICE on September 21st. Will always be better than working from home!
....It was spoken as a fact not as a statement. It’s very simple nobody should have any problem with this other than the haters and those looking to cause trouble on social media. Honor the memory of George Floyd!
Great being with the National Champion Clemson Tigers last night at the White House. Because of the Shutdown I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid) over 1000 hamburgers etc. Within one hour it was all gone. Great guys and big eaters!
Great night in Pennsylvania. Big and Enthusiastic Crowd. Will be back soon. VOTE!!!
Andrew McCabe FIRED a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy. Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy. He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI!
Do you think the three UCLA Basketball Players will say thank you President Trump? They were headed for 10 years in jail!
Nobody in 50 years has been WEAKER on China than Sleepy Joe Biden. He was asleep at the wheel. He gave them EVERYTHING they wanted including rip-off Trade Deals. I am getting it all back!
I’ve gone through years of a Fake Illegal and Totally Discredited Witch-Hunt and now it’s revealed that it was a Hoax by the "other side" which must pay a price for what they did. Think of where we’d be now without Fake & Fraudulent stories every night for years!!!
Sleepy Joe Biden just agreed with the Radical Left Democrats to raise Taxes by Three Trillion Dollars. Everyone will pay - Will kill your Stocks 401k’s and the ECONOMY. BIG CRASH!  #MAGA
This is a great day for civilization. I am proud of the United States for sticking by me in following a necessary but somewhat unconventional path. People have been trying to make this "Deal" for many years. Millions of lives will be saved. Congratulations to ALL!
I will totally protect your Medicare & Social Security!
Concast (@NBCNews) and Fake News @CNN are going out of their way to say GREAT things about China. They are Chinese puppets who want to do business there. They use USA airwaves to help China. The Enemy of the People!
Biden failed with China. They took us to the cleaners! I got $Billions out of China and gave much of it to our targeted farmers!
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
New Stock Market high! I will never get bored of telling you that – and we will never get tired of winning!
"Nancy Pelosi said it’s not a question of proof it’s a question of allegations! Oh really?"  @JudgeJeanine @FoxNews  What a disgrace this Impeachment Scam is for our great Country!
My warmest sympathy and best wishes goes out to the people of New Zealand after the horrible massacre in the Mosques. 49 innocent people have so senselessly died with so many more seriously injured. The U.S. stands by New Zealand for anything we can do. God bless all!
The biggest loser tonight by far is Mini Mike Bloomberg. His "political" consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!
Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that "ABC does not tolerate comments like those" made by Roseanne Barr. Gee he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn’t get the call?
Another very bad terror attack in France. We are going to strengthen our borders even more. Chuck and Nancy must give us the votes to get additional Border Security!
Praying for Ryan Newman a great and brave @NASCAR driver! #PrayingForRyan
U.S. Cancer Death Rate Lowest In Recorded History! A lot of good news coming out of this Administration.
Wow! Was just told that my son’s book "Triggered" is Number One on The New York Times Bestseller List. Congratulations Don!
What happened to General Michael Flynn a war hero should never be allowed to happen to a citizen of the United States again!
At least 7 dead and 48 wounded in terror attack and Mayor of London says there is "no reason to be alarmed!"
The professionally managed so-called "protesters" at the White House had little to do with the memory of George Floyd. They were just there to cause trouble. The @SecretService handled them easily. Tonight I understand is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???
The anti-Semitic attack in Monsey New York on the 7th night of Hanukkah last night is horrific. We must all come together to fight confront and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism. Melania and I wish the victims a quick and full recovery.
Republicans and Democrats MUST come together finally with a major Border Security package which will include funding for the Wall. After 40 years of talk it is finally time for action. Fix the Border for once and for all NOW!
We have a totally corrupt previous Administration including a President and Vice President who spied on my campaign AND GOT CAUGHT...and nothing happens to them. This crime was taking place even before my election everyone knows it and yet all are frozen stiff with fear....
Congratulations to Boris Johnson on becoming the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. He will be great!
On June 10th the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico and into our Country STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied..
WATCH THE BALLOTS!!!
I am working very hard to help New York City & State. Dealing with both Mayor & Governor and producing tremendously for them including four new medical centers and four new hospitals. Fake News that I won’t help them because I don’t like Cuomo (I do). Just sent 4000 ventilators!
Despite the constant negative press covfefe
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Our Country is doing so well in so many ways. Great jobs numbers with a record setting December. We are rebuilding our military. Vets finally have Choice & Accountability. Economy & GDP are strong. Tax & Reg cuts historic. Trade deals great. But we MUST fix our Southern Border!
I am in Japan at the G-20 representing our Country well but I heard it was not a good day for Sleepy Joe or Crazy Bernie. One is exhausted the other is nuts - so what’s the big deal?
A "Favored Nations Clause" against Big Pharma which I signed last week means that the USA gets a price on Prescription Drugs that matches the price of the Country that pays the lowest price anywhere in the World. 50% 60% maybe 70% reduction. No other President would do this!
... and/or Funding which will be taken away if this Propaganda or Act Against Public Policy continues. Our children must be Educated not Indoctrinated!
Where have the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of Qassem Soleimani one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? He was also looking to do big future damage! Dems are "unhinged."
Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years! I would like to see them go even lower.
Please to inform that the Champion Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL will be joining me at the White House for Ceremony. Great team!
Joe Biden just said "We believe in facts not truth." Does anybody really believe he is mentally fit to be president? We are "playing" in a very big and complicated world. Joe doesn’t have a clue!
The New York Times changed headlines 3 times in order to satisfy the Radical Left. What should have been a good story got "worse & worse" until the headline alone made it very unfair. Fake & Corrupt News that is very dangerous for our Country!
Great honor I think?  Mark Zuckerberg recently stated that "Donald J. Trump is Number 1 on Facebook. Number 2 is Prime Minister Modi of India." Actually I am going to India in two weeks. Looking forward to it!
"Players take knee raise fist stay in locker room during National Anthem". @FoxNews No thanks tell them to "protest" some other time!
Can you believe that Shifty Adam Schiff the biggest leaker in D.C. and a corrupt politician is upset that we didn’t inform him before we raided and killed the #1 terrorist in the WORLD!? Wouldn’t be surprised if the Do Nothing Democrats Impeach me over that! DRAIN THE SWAMP!!
I as President want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again people coming in through a system based on MERIT. No more Lotteries! #AMERICA FIRST
The "Trump Doctrine" earns President Trump a third Nobel Peace Prize Nomination! @LouDobbs
I will be making a major announcement concerning the Humanitarian Crisis on our Southern Border and the Shutdown tomorrow afternoon at 3 P.M. live from the @WhiteHouse.
Another win just in. Nervous Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress sued me thrown out. This one unanimous in the D.C. Circuit.Witch Hunt!
Nancy Pelosi wants Congress to take away authority Presidents use to stand up to other countries and defend AMERICANS. Stand with your Commander in Chiefs!
Just spoke to my friend MBS (Crown Prince) of Saudi Arabia who spoke with President Putin of Russia & I expect & hope that they will be cutting back approximately 10 Million Barrels and maybe substantially more which if it happens will be GREAT for the oil & gas industry!
...our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not YOU'RE FIRED. Find something else to do!
Here we go again another Con Job by the Do Nothing Democrats. All of this work was supposed to be done by the House not the Senate!
Tell the Democrat Governors that "Mutiny On The Bounty" was one of my all time favorite movies. A good old fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch especially when the mutineers need so much from the Captain. Too easy!
Democrats = 17 Witnesses. Republicans = 0 Witnesses.
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT! It should never be allowed to happen again!
We will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN & HIRE AMERICAN!#InaugurationDay #MAGA🇺🇸
Last week the Fake News said that a section of our powerful under construction Southern Border Wall "fell over" trying to make it sound terrible except the reason was that the concrete foundation was just poured & soaking wet when big winds kicked in. Quickly fixed "forever".
Our GREAT MILITARY has delivered justice for the heroes lost and wounded in the cowardly attack on the USS Cole. We have just killed the leader of that attack Jamal al-Badawi. Our work against al Qaeda continues. We will never stop in our fight against Radical Islamic Terrorism!
Democrats are kidding themselves (they don’t really believe it!) if they say you can stop Crime Drugs Human Trafficking and Caravans without a Wall or Steel Barrier. Stop playing games and give America the Security it deserves. A Humanitarian Crisis!
THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.
The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They are suffering a major "breakdown" have ZERO credibility or respect & must be thinking about going legit. I have learned to live with Fake News which has never been more corrupt than it is right now. Someday I will tell you the secret!
No matter how many witnesses you give the Democrats no matter how much information is given like the quickly produced Transcripts it will NEVER be enough for them. They will always scream UNFAIR. The Impeachment Hoax is just another political CON JOB!
Do you think it’s just luck that gas prices are so low and falling? Low gas prices are like another Tax Cut!
It would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid Democrat inspired immigration laws. In less than one hour and then a vote the problem would be solved. But the Dems don’t care about the crime they don’t want any victory for Trump and the Republicans even if good for USA!
Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants or Illegal Immigrants "Animals." Wrong! They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories. I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as "Animals" a big difference - and so true. Fake News got it purposely wrong as usual!
So proud of our great Military which will soon be after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars the finest that our Country has ever had. There won’t be anything or anyone even close!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
.@Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is today criticizing Twitter. "We have a different policy than Twitter on this. I believe strongly that Facebook shouldn’t be the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online." Did Twitter criticize Obama for his "you can keep your Dr."?
Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is having a really bad night. I think she is sending signals that she wants out. Calling for unity is her way of getting there going home and having a "nice cold beer" with her husband!
Wow just heard that my poll numbers with Hispanics has gone up 19% to 50%. That is because they know the Border issue better than anyone and they want Security which can only be gotten with a Wall.
"We demand fairness" shouts Pelosi and the Do Nothing Democrats yet the Dems in the House wouldn’t let us have 1 witness no lawyers or even ask questions. It was the most unfair witch-hunt in the history of Congress!
A great day for Republicans a great day for our Country!
I have now spent more time in Vietnam than Da Nang Dick Blumenthal the third rate Senator from Connecticut (how is Connecticut doing?). His war stories of his heroism in Vietnam were a total fraud - he was never even there. We talked about it today with Vietnamese leaders!
Governors get your states testing programs & apparatus perfected. Be ready big things are happening. No excuses! The Federal Government is there to help. We are testing more than any country in the World. Also gear up with Face Masks!
I was criticized by the Democrats when I closed the Country down to China many weeks ahead of what almost everyone recommended. Saved many lives. Dems were working the Impeachment Hoax. They didn’t have a clue! Now they are fear mongering. Be calm & vigilant!
Republican Approval Rating just hit 93%. Sorry Haters! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Ford General Motors and Tesla are being given the go ahead to make ventilators and other metal products FAST! @fema  Go for it auto execs lets see how good you are? @RepMarkMeadows @GOPLeader @senatemajldr
The ObamaBiden Administration was the most corrupt in history including the fact that they got caught SPYING ON MY CAMPAIGN the biggest political scandal in the history of our Country. It’s called Treason and more. Thanks for your very kind words Michelle!
Joe Biden says this is a race between Scranton and Park Avenue. This is a race between Scranton and China. Joe Biden betrayed Scranton and America to China and foreign countries. I will always put America First!
I will always protect our great warfighters. I’ve got your backs!
I want to thank all Republicans for the work you have done in dealing with the Radical Left on Border Security. Not an easy task but the Wall is being built and will be a great achievement and contributor toward life and safety within our Country!
It was my great honor to free up 5000 square miles of ocean off the coast of Maine. Enjoy!
Twitter "SHADOW BANNING" prominent Republicans. Not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once! Many complaints.
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Just out: 3.7% Unemployment is the lowest number since 1969!
Facebook Google and Twitter not to mention the Corrupt Media are sooo on the side of the Radical Left Democrats. But fear not we will win anyway just like we did before! #MAGA
"I REALLY DON’T CARE DO U?" written on the back of Melania’s jacket refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are and she truly no longer cares!
Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melania is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
V.P. Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives today. Many details of Border Security were discussed. We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger & less obtrusive. Good solution and made in the U.S.A.
The Democrats together with the corrupt Fake News Media have launched a massive Disinformation Campaign the likes of which has never been seen before. They will say anything like their recent lies about me and the Military and hope that it sticks... But #MAGA gets it!
For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states not that of the President of the United States & the Federal Government. Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect....
.@FoxNews is not watchable during weekend afternoons. It is worse than Fake News @CNN. I strongly suggest turning your dial to @OANN. They do a really "Fair & Balanced" job!
....Detention facilities are not Concentration Camps! America has never been stronger than it is now – rebuilt Military highest Stock Market EVER lowest unemployment and more people working than ever before. Keep America Great!
So now Congressman Adam Schiff announces after having found zero Russian Collusion that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life both financial and personal even though there is no reason to be doing so. Never happened before! Unlimited Presidential Harassment....
"Defunding Police would be good for Robbers & Rapists." @SenBillCassidy
Unemployment is down to 4.1% lowest in 17 years. 1.5 million new jobs created since I took office. Highest stock Market ever up $5.4 trill
A disgraceful verdict in the Kate Steinle case! No wonder the people of our Country are so angry with Illegal Immigration.
....I will never stop working to secure the release of all Americans held hostage overseas! Thank you Switzerland for your great assistance.
To this point and because we have had a very strong border policy we have had 40 deaths related to CoronaVirus. If we had weak or open borders that number would be many times higher!
"Do you think Suburban Women want to Defund the Police? I don’t think so." @marcthiessen
AMERICA FIRST!
I want to applaud the many protestors in Boston who are speaking out against bigotry and hate. Our country will soon come together as one!
If President Obama made the deals that I have made both at the Border and for the Economy the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible & a National Holiday would be immediately declared. With me despite our record setting Economy and all that I have done no credit!
Great credit being given for our Coronavirus response except in the Fake News. They are a disgrace to America!
Will be doing a press conference today at 5:00 P.M. The White House. People are working harder than I have ever seen people work. It is a beautiful thing to watch!
Wow such enthusiasm and energy for Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Look at the Energy look at the Polls. Something very big is happening. He is a fine man and great intellect. The country is with him all the way!
...NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.
We MUST protect our National Parks for our children and grandchildren. I am calling on the House to pass the GREAT AMERICAN OUTDOORS ACT today. Thanks @SenCoryGardner and @SteveDaines for all your work on this HISTORIC BILL!
Democrats are not interested in Border Safety & Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military. They are only interested in Obstruction!
Stock Market hits an ALL-TIME high! Unemployment lowest in 16 years! Business and manufacturing enthusiasm at highest level in decades!
.@SteveScully the Never Trumper next debate moderator got caught cold. Pulled out the old "I’ve been hacked" line. That never works. His bosses are furious at him as he’s lost all credibility!
No I want Big Ten and all other football back - NOW. The Dems don’t want football back for political reasons but are trying to blame me and the Republicans. Another LIE but this is what we are up against! They should also open up all of their Shutdown States.
Marshawn Lynch of the NFL’s Oakland Raiders stands for the Mexican Anthem and sits down to boos for our National Anthem. Great disrespect! Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season. Attendance and ratings way down.
Wow so many Fake News stories today. No matter what I do or say they will not write or speak truth. The Fake News Media is out of control!
Liberal Hollywood is Racist at the highest level and with great Anger and Hate! They like to call themselves "Elite" but they are not Elite. In fact it is often the people that they so strongly oppose that are actually the Elite. The movie coming out is made in order....
Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria instead of the United States. See? Isn’t it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country the U.S. that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!
All that time and money spent and it turns out that the Mueller Investigation was a total SCAM!
Thank you to LSU and Alabama for a great game!
Oh I get it! I am a very good developer happily living my life when I see our Country going in the wrong direction (to put it mildly). Against all odds I decide to run for President & continue to run my business-very legal & very cool talked about it on the campaign trail...
Iranian Harassment of U.S. Warships:2015: 222016: 362017: 142018: 0Source: @USNavy
AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!
Congratulations to the Great State of Tennessee. You’ve got yourselves a fantastic football team. Big WIN last night!
Absentee Ballots are fine. A person has to go through a process to get and use them. Mail-In Voting on the other hand will lead to the most corrupt Election is USA history. Bad things happen with Mail-Ins. Just look at Special Election in Patterson N.J. 19% of Ballots a FRAUD!
Getting VERY close to a BIG DEAL with China. They want it and so do we!
When will the Radical Left Congresswomen apologize to our Country the people of Israel and even to the Office of the President for the foul language they have used and the terrible things they have said. So many people are angry at them & their horrible & disgusting actions!
I have asked Steve Daines our great Republican Senator from Montana to attend his daughter Annie’s wedding rather than coming to today’s vote. Steve was ready to do whatever he had to but we had the necessary number. To the Daines Family congratulations-have a wonderful day!
I am fully prepared to use the full power of the Federal Government to deal with our current challenge of the CoronaVirus!
The thugs who accosted Senator @RandPaul and his wonderful wife Kelly together with those who made threats to many other people who had just attended the Republican National Convention at the White House must be sought out and immediately arrested. Well documented evidence!
My decision to appoint @usairforce General Charles Brown as the USA’s first-ever African American military service chief has now been approved by the Senate. A historic day for America! Excited to work even more closely with Gen. Brown who is a Patriot and Great Leader!
We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!
I am lowering not raising Medicare Premiums!
Great job last night at the White House by the U.S. @SecretService. They were not only totally professional but very cool. I was inside watched every move and couldn’t have felt more safe. They let the "protesters" scream & rant as much as they wanted but whenever someone....
So President Obama knew about Russia before the Election. Why didn’t he do something about it? Why didn’t he tell our campaign? Because it is all a big hoax that’s why and he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win!!!
To those in the Caravan turnaround we are not letting people into the United States illegally. Go back to your Country and if you want apply for citizenship like millions of others are doing!
HAPPY NEW YEAR! We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN and much faster than anyone thought possible!
Sadly there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall!
......MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN!
Cryin Chuck told his favorite lie when he used his standard sound bite that I "slammed the table & walked out of the room. He had a temper tantrum." Because I knew he would say that and after Nancy said no to proper Border Security I politely said bye-bye and left no slamming!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN which is happening and then KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL which is desperately needed for our National Defense is not fully funded.
Be nice if Spike Lee could read his notes or better yet not have to use notes at all when doing his racist hit on your President who has done more for African Americans (Criminal Justice Reform Lowest Unemployment numbers in History Tax Cutsetc.) than almost any other Pres!
The question I was asked most today by fellow World Leaders who think the USA is doing so well and is stronger than ever before happens to be "Mr. President why does the American media hate your Country so much? Why are they rooting for it to fail?"
Where’s the Whistleblower? Where’s the second Whistleblower? Where’s the Informer? Why did Corrupt politician Schiff MAKE UP my conversation with the Ukrainian President??? Why didn’t the House do its job? And sooo much more!
Roger Stone was targeted by an illegal Witch Hunt that never should have taken place. It is the other side that are criminals including Biden and Obama who spied on my campaign - AND GOT CAUGHT!
Has @BubbaWallace apologized to all of those great NASCAR drivers & officials who came to his aid stood by his side & were willing to sacrifice everything for him only to find out that the whole thing was just another HOAX? That & Flag decision has caused lowest ratings EVER!
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fully understands especially after his humiliating defeat that if there is no Wall there is no DACA. We must have safety and security together with a strong Military for our great people!
For those asking the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate and they need 60. That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election! We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border) and even better to our Military & Veterans!
Since the first day I took office all you hear is the phony Democrat excuse for losing the election Russia RussiaRussia.  Despite this I have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any 10 month President. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Just spoke to King Salman of Saudi Arabia and explained to him that because of the turmoil & disfunction in Iran and Venezuela I am asking that Saudi Arabia increase oil production maybe up to 2000000 barrels to make up the difference...Prices to high! He has agreed!
I am the only person who can fight for the safety of our troops & bring them home from the ridiculous & costly Endless Wars and be scorned. Democrats always liked that position until I took it. Democrats always liked Walls until I built them. Do you see what’s happening here?
....They are anti-Israel pro Al-Qaeda and comment on the 9/11 attack "some people did something." Radical Left Democrats want Open Borders which means drugs crime human trafficking and much more....
Hope you are enjoying your President’s Day our Country is making unprecedented progress!
The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation in just twelve months than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office no matter what the length. The good news is THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME!
The only thing that I have done wrong is to win an election that was expected to be won by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. The problem is they forgot to campaign in numerous states!
People don’t remember the chaos hatred & discord that we all went through during the 8 years of Obama/Biden. St. Louis Oakland Baltimore and so many other places  were a complete & total disaster. I wouldn’t be in the beautiful White House if it weren’t for Sleepy Joe etc.
Biden made another big mistake. He totally mixed up two Crime Bills. Didn’t have a clue (as usual!). Also he freely used the term SUPER PREDATOR!!!
Broke all time Stock Market Record again today. 135 times since my 2016 Election Win. Thank you!
Next week ICE will begin the process of removing the millions of illegal aliens who have illicitly found their way into the United States. They will be removed as fast as they come in. Mexico using their strong immigration laws is doing a very good job of stopping people.......
So they now convict Roger Stone of lying and want to jail him for many years to come. Well what about Crooked Hillary Comey Strzok Page McCabe Brennan Clapper Shifty Schiff Ohr & Nellie Steele & all of the others including even Mueller himself? Didn’t they lie?....
Sorry we cannot let our friends or enemies take advantage of us on Trade anymore. We must put the American worker first!
Crooked H destroyed phones w/ hammer 'bleached' emails & had husband meet w/AG days before she was cleared- & they talk about obstruction?
Police Chief and most of the police in Rochester N.Y. have resigned. The Democrat Mayor and of courses Governor Cuomo have no idea what to do. New York State is a mess - No Money High Taxes & Crime Everyone Fleeing. November 3rd. We can fix it!
The Obama Administration built the Cages not the Trump Administration! DEMOCRATS MUST GIVE US THE VOTES TO CHANGE BAD IMMIGRATION LAWS.
So some day if a Democrat becomes President and the Republicans win the House even by a tiny margin they can impeach the President without due process or fairness or any legal rights. All Republicans must remember what they are witnessing here - a lynching. But we will WIN!
The Senate Intelligence Committee: THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA!
"Chaos lawlessness and destruction take over New York." @FoxNews  When will Governor Cuomo call the Federal Government for help?
Everyone is asking how Tiger played yesterday. The answer is Great! He was long straight & putted fantastically well. He shot a 64. Tiger is back & will be winning Majors again! Not surprisingly Jack also played really well. His putting is amazing! Jack & Tiger like each other.
Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today. He was treated very unfairly by our government!
The World has taken a big step back from potential Nuclear catastrophe! No more rocket launches nuclear testing or research! The hostages are back home with their families. Thank you to Chairman Kim our day together was historic!
Somebody please explain to Cryin’ Chuck Schumer that we do have a military man in charge of distributing goods a very talented Admiral in fact. New York has gotten far more than any other State including hospitals & a hospital ship but no matter what always complaining.....
Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey who at one point I knew very well interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted the facts incorrect. Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others!
If anybody but your favorite President Donald J. Trump announced that after decimating ISIS in Syria we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy) that person would be the most popular hero in America. With me hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!
Do RINO’S Pat Toomey & Mitt Romney have any problem with the fact that we caught Obama Biden & Company illegally spying on my campaign? Do they care if Comey McCabe Page & her lover Peter S the whole group ran rampant wild & unchecked - lying & leaking all the way? NO!
2019 HOLIDAY RETAIL SALES WERE UP 3.4% FROM LAST YEAR THE BIGGEST NUMBER IN U.S. HISTORY. CONGRATULATIONS AMERICA!
Here’s a great stat - since January 2017 the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1.9 million. The American people are finally back to work!
I greatly appreciate Nancy Pelosi’s statement against impeachment but everyone must remember the minor fact that I never did anything wrong the Economy and Unemployment are the best ever Military and Vets are great - and many other successes! How do you impeach....
Very good reviews on last night’s @NBCNews Town Hall in Miami. Thank you!!!
Big story out that the FBI ignored tens of thousands of Crooked Hillary Emails many of which are REALLY BAD. Also gave false election info. I feel sure that we will soon be getting to the bottom of all of this corruption. At some point I may have to get involved!
I’ve had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President. Now I have to put up with a Fake Book written by a totally discredited author. Ronald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well. So will I!
Just like Radical Left New York is trying to destroy the NRA if Biden becomes President your GREAT SECOND AMENDMENT doesn’t have a chance. Your guns will be taken away immediately and without notice. No police no guns!
"Trying to use the 25th Amendment to try and circumvent the Election is a despicable act of unconstitutional power grabbing...which happens in third world countries. You have to obey the law. This is an attack on our system & Constitution." Alan Dershowitz. @TuckerCarlson
I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt
Good numbers coming out of States that are opening. America is getting its life back! Vaccine work is looking VERY promising before end of year. Likewise other solutions!
Four people in Nevada viciously robbed and killed by an illegal immigrant who should not have been in our Country. 26 people killed on the Border in a drug and gang related fight. Two large Caravans from Honduras broke into Mexico and are headed our way. We need a powerful Wall!
Think how wonderful it is to be able to fight back and show to so many how totally dishonest the Fake News Media really is. It may be the most corrupt and disgusting business (almost) there is! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Will soon be heading to Davos Switzerland to tell the world how great America is and is doing. Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing will only get better...Our country is finally WINNING again!
Highly respected Senator Richard Burr Chairman of Senate Intelligence said today that after an almost two year investigation he saw no evidence of Russia collusion. "We don’t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the Trump campaign and Russia."  Thank you!
Congratulations to France who played extraordinary soccer on winning the 2018 World Cup. Additionally congratulations to President Putin and Russia for putting on a truly great World Cup Tournament -- one of the best ever!
I got severely criticized by the Fake News Media for being too nice to President Putin. In the Old Days they would call it Diplomacy. If I was loud & vicious I would have been criticized for being too tough. Remember when they said I was too tough with Chairman Kim? Hypocrites!
AMERICA FIRST!
"President Trump would need a magic wand to get to 4% GDP" stated President Obama. I guess I have a magic wand 4.2% and we will do MUCH better than this! We have just begun.
In the "old days" if you were President and you had a good economy you were basically immune from criticism. Remember "It’s the economy stupid." Today I have as President perhaps the greatest economy in history...and to the Mainstream Media it means NOTHING. But it will!
Much more "disinformation" coming out of CNN MSDNC @nytimes and @washingtonpost by far than coming out of any foreign country even combined. Fake News is the Enemy of the People!
If Roger Stone was indicted for lying to Congress what about the lying done by Comey Brennan Clapper Lisa Page & lover Baker and soooo many others? What about Hillary to FBI and her 33000 deleted Emails? What about Lisa & Peter’s deleted texts & Wiener’s laptop? Much more!
Hispanics seem to be strongly favoring President Trump! @OANN
Without a Wall there cannot be safety and security at the Border or for the U.S.A. BUILD THE WALL AND CRIME WILL FALL!
People are coming from far and wide to join us today and tonight for what is turning out to be one of the biggest celebrations in the history of our Country SALUTE TO AMERICA an all day event at the Lincoln Memorial culminating with large scale flyovers of the most modern.....
There is nothing we can ever give to the Democrats that will make them happy. This is the highest level of Presidential Harassment in the history of our Country!
America owes our very hard working food supply workers so much as they produce and deliver high quality food for us during this horrible COVID-19. Join me in thanking our Farmers Ranchers Processors Distributors and Stores! @JohnBoozman
I’m with the TRUCKERS all the way. Thanks for the meeting at the White House with my representatives from the Administration. It is all going to work out well!
Thank you to @NASA and @SpaceX for their hard work and leadership. Look forward to being back with you on Saturday!
Joe Biden and the Radical Left want to Abolish Police Abolish ICE Abolish Bail Abolish Suburbs Abolish the 2nd Amendment – and Abolish the American Way of Life. No one will be SAFE in Joe Biden’s America!
I am proud to have fought for and secured the LOWEST African American and Hispanic unemployment rates in history. Now I’m pushing for prison reform to give people who have paid their debt to society a second chance. I will never stop fighting for ALL Americans!
The Lamestream Media is not talking about what is happening with the Stock Market and JOBS. Both are doing GREAT! The Radical Left will destroy the USA. Be careful what you wish for!
....The only reason they do not want to build a Wall is that Walls Work! 99% of our illegal Border crossings will end crime in our Country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year! A properly planned and constructed Wall will pay for itself many times a year!
America First!
I called the politicization of the China Virus by the Radical Left Democrats a Hoax not the China Virus itself. Everybody knows this except for the Fake and very Corrupt Media!
Watching the Dodgers/Red Sox final innings. It is amazing how a manager takes out a pitcher who is loose & dominating through almost 7 innings Rich Hill of Dodgers and brings in nervous reliever(s) who get shellacked. 4 run lead gone. Managers do it all the time big mistake!
Where’s the Fake Whistleblower?
It’s amazing what I’ve done the most of any President in the first three years (by far) considering that for three years I’ve been under phony political investigations and the Impeachment Hoax! KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
I was recently asked if Crooked Hillary Clinton is going to run in 2020? My answer was "I hope so!"
Cases Cases Cases! If we didn’t test so much and so successfully we would have very few cases. If you test 40000000 people you are going to have many cases that without the testing (like other countries) would not show up every night on the Fake Evening News.....
Steve Scully the second Debate Moderator is a Never Trumper just like the son of the great Mike Wallace. Fix!!!
Just landed in Nevada but while on Air Force One watched most vicious TV commercial I have ever seen. Pathetic Joe’s people placed an unsourced ad where they have me saying unthinkable things about soldiers while standing over their graves. It is a MADE UP LIE. A TOTAL CON JOB!
You mean the Stock Market hit an all-time record high today and they’re actually talking impeachment!? Will I ever be given credit for anything by the Fake News Media or Radical Liberal Dems? NO COLLUSION!
Rep Elijah Cummings has been a brutal bully shouting and screaming at the great men & women of Border Patrol about conditions at the Southern Border when actually his Baltimore district is FAR WORSE and more dangerous. His district is considered the Worst in the USA......
Today we remember the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in serving. Thank you God bless your families & God bless the USA!
The Democrats are just ANGRY that the vaccine and delivery are so far ahead of schedule. They hate what they are seeing. Saving lives should make them happy not sad!
What was Nike thinking?
Today I authorized the lowering of the flags to half-staff at all Federal Government buildings in honor of the victims of the tragedies in El Paso Texas and Dayton Ohio....
"I think this is probably the most consequential media screwup of the last 25 to 50 years. It is difficult to comprehend or overstate the damage that the media did to the Country to their own reputation or to the Constitution. An absolute catastrophe" Sean Davis  @TuckerCarlson
Democrats only want BAILOUT MONEY for Blue States that are doing badly. They don’t care about the people never did!
Big News: Tom Tiffany of the Great State of Wisconsin has just become Congressman Tom Tiffany. He will do a FANTASTIC job for the people of Wisconsin and the United States. Congratulations!
If anyone is looking for a good lawyer I would strongly suggest that you don’t retain the services of Michael Cohen!
I am extremely pleased to see that @CNN has finally been exposed as #FakeNews and garbage journalism. It's about time!
You mean they are just now finding votes in Florida and Georgia – but the Election was on Tuesday? Let’s blame the Russians and demand an immediate apology from President Putin!
"These were the people that trashed Seattle years ago. Who’s paying for these people. I was appalled that 13 of Joe Biden’s staff were donating money to bail people out in Minneapolis. They should have stayed in jail until this is over (and beyond)." @newtgingrich @foxandfriends
So now Comey’s admitting he was wrong. Wow but he’s only doing so because he got caught red handed. He was actually caught a long time ago. So what are the consequences for his unlawful conduct. Could it be years in jail? Where are the apologies to me and others Jim?
Very sad day & night in Paris. Maybe it’s time to end the ridiculous and extremely expensive Paris Agreement and return money back to the people in the form of lower taxes? The U.S. was way ahead of the curve on that and the only major country where emissions went down last year!
....Kahn reminds me very much of our very dumb and incompetent Mayor of NYC de Blasio who has also done a terrible job - only half his height. In any event I look forward to being a great friend to the United Kingdom and am looking very much forward to my visit. Landing now!
To the great and brave men and women of ICE do not worry or lose your spirit. You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe by eradicating the worst criminal elements. So brave! The radical left Dems want you out. Next it will be all police. Zero chance It will never happen!
Just won lawsuit filed by the DNC and a bunch of Democrat crazies trying to claim the Trump Campaign (and others) colluded with Russia. They haven’t figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election!
New York State is killing small businesses. Let them properly open! @foxandfriends
As President I have an obligation to end CORRUPTION even if that means requesting the help of a foreign country or countries. It is done all the time. This has NOTHING to do with politics or a political campaign against the Bidens. This does have to do with their corruption!
....In addition to stopping all payments to these countries which seem to have almost no control over their population I must in the strongest of terms ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military and CLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!..
Endless Wars especially those which are fought out of judgement mistakes that were made many years ago & those where we are getting little financial or military help from the rich countries that so greatly benefit from what we are doing will eventually come to a glorious end!
If I didn’t INSIST on having the National Guard activate and go into Kenosha Wisconsin there would be no Kenosha right now. Also there would have been great death and injury. I want to thank Law Enforcement and the National Guard. I will see you on Tuesday!
The Democrats are so self righteous and ANGRY! Loosen up and have some fun. The Country is doing well!
I will be having a news conference today at 3:00 P.M. The White House. Topic: CoronaVirus!
Is this even possible to believe? Can this be for real? Where is this nursing home how is the victim doing?
Iran killed an American contractor wounding many. We strongly responded and always will. Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy and so notified!
The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U.S. say the haters & losers. We have our hostages testing research and all missle launches have stoped and these pundits who have called me wrong from the beginning have nothing else they can say! We will be fine!
The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.
So when will something significant happen to James Comey? Got caught cold. He is either very dumb or one of the worst liars in political history. TOO LONG. EMBARRASSING!
If Congress doesn’t bring fairness to Big Tech which they should have done years ago I will do it myself with Executive Orders. In Washington it has been ALL TALK and NO ACTION for years and the people of our Country are sick and tired of it!
It’s very sad that Nancy Pelosi and her sidekick Cryin’ Chuck Schumer want to protect illegal immigrants far more than the citizens of our country. The United States cannot stand for this. We wants safety and security at our borders!
I have just ordered Homeland Security to step up our already Extreme Vetting Program. Being politically correct is fine but not for this!
Don’t worry wonderful & beautiful Alaska there will be NO POLITICS in the Pebble Mine Review Process. I will do what is right for Alaska and our great Country!!!
Only fools or people with a political agenda don’t want a Wall or Steel Barrier to protect our Country from Crime Drugs and Human Trafficking. It will happen - it always does!
Catch and Release is an obsolete term. It is now Catch and Detain. Illegal Immigrants trying to come into the U.S.A. often proudly flying the flag of their nation as they ask for U.S. Asylum will be detained or turned away. Dems must approve Border Security & Wall NOW!
President Obama made a desperate and terrible deal with Iran - Gave them 150 Billion Dollars plus I.8 Billion Dollars in CASH! Iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out. Gave them a free path to Nuclear Weapons and SOON. Instead of saying thank you Iran yelled.....
So much FAKE NEWS!
I am pleased to inform you that I have just granted a full Pardon to 85 year old American patriot Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He kept Arizona safe!
.@newtgingrich just stated that there has been no president since Abraham Lincoln who has been treated worse or more unfairly by the media than your favorite President me! At the same time there has been no president who has accomplished more in his first two years in office!
I’ve had great "ratings" my whole life there’s nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are "through the roof"(Monday Night Football Bachelor Finale  @nytimes) but I don’t care about that. I care about going around the Fake News to the PEOPLE!
I was going to go to Bedminster New Jersey this weekend but wanted to stay in Washington D.C. to make sure LAW & ORDER is enforced. The arsonists anarchists looters and agitators have been largely stopped...
To those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don’t want to be dominated and controlled by Iran this is your time!
Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady Melania. Successful procedure she is in good spirits. Thank you to all of the well-wishers!
"I’m running as a proud Democrat for the Senate". Sleepy Joe Biden today. It’s only going to get worse. It is not sustainable for our County - China will own us!!!!
The Whistleblower has disappeared. Where is the Whistleblower?
Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter. This is not acceptable. They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion. Get back to the basics and make us all proud!
So funny that The New York Times & The Washington Post got a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage (100% NEGATIVE and FAKE!) of Collusion with Russia - And there was No Collusion! So they were either duped or corrupt? In any event their prizes should be taken away by the Committee!
When you see "anonymous source" stop reading the story it is fiction!
They are staging a coup against Bernie!
The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to belittle my VERY successful trip to London for NATO. I got along great with the NATO leaders even getting them to pay $130 Billion a year more & $400 Billion a year more in 3 years. No increase for U.S. only deep respect!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Consideration is being given to declaring ANTIFA the gutless Radical Left Wack Jobs who go around hitting (only non-fighters) people over the heads with baseball bats a major Organization of Terror (along with MS-13 & others). Would make it easier for police to do their job!
GREAT JOBS NUMBERS JUST ANNOUNCED!
Of course we should have captured Osama Bin Laden long before we did. I pointed him out in my book just BEFORE the attack on the World Trade Center. President Clinton famously missed his shot. We paid Pakistan Billions of Dollars & they never told us he was living there. Fools!..
Now that Russian collusion after one year of intense study has proven to be a total hoax on the American public the Democrats and their lapdogs the Fake News Mainstream Media are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence.....
Wacko John Bolton’s "exceedingly tedious"(New York Times) book is made up of lies & fake stories. Said all good about me in print until the day I fired him. A disgruntled boring fool who only wanted to go to war. Never had a clue was ostracized & happily dumped. What a dope!
"It’s about the Economy stupid" except when it comes to Trump. The fact is the Fake News Media hates talking about the Economy and how incredible it is!
President Macron of France has just suggested that Europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the U.S. China and Russia. Very insulting but perhaps Europe should first pay its fair share of NATO which the U.S. subsidizes greatly!
Why isn’t Congressman Adam Schiff being brought up on charges for fraudulently making up a statement and reading it to Congress as if this statement which was very dishonest and bad for me was directly made by the President of the United States? This should never be allowed!
Texas to open businesses in phases beginning Friday. Great job being done by @GregAbbott_TX
RECORD HIGH NASDAQ! It would all come crashing down including your Jobs Stocks and 401k’s if Sleepy Joe ever became President. China and others would own us!!!
Strong Stock Market Numbers. You want to see them dive? Vote for the Radical Left with their BIG Tax Hikes!
Funny how lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me at will even blaming me for the current spate of Bombs and ridiculously comparing this to September 11th and the Oklahoma City bombing yet when I criticize them they go wild and scream "it’s just not Presidential!"
CNN’S slogan is CNN THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS. Everyone knows this is not true that this could in fact be a fraud on the American Public. There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN. Their slogan should be CNN THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS!
The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. From this moment on it’s going to be #AmericaFirst🇺🇸
When is Slow Joe Biden going to criticize the Anarchists Thugs & Agitators in ANTIFA? When is he going to suggest bringing up the National Guard in BADLY RUN & Crime Infested Democrat Cities & States? Remember he can’t lose the Crazy Bernie Super Liberal vote!
We have now built 240 Miles of new Border Wall on our Southern Border. We will have over 450 Miles built by the end of the year. Have established some of the best Border Numbers ever. The Radical Left Democrats want Open Borders for anyone including many criminals to come in!
....to inflame and cause chaos. They create their own violence and then try to blame others. They are the true Racists and are very bad for our Country!
Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don’t know and/or have never met. FAKE NEWS!
Why did Nervous Nancy allow corrupt politician Shifty Schiff to lie before Congress? He must be a Witness and so should she!
Why didn’t President Obama do something about Russia in September (before November Election) when told by the FBI? He did NOTHING and had no intention of doing anything!
Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America. There has never been anything like it. Now Disney J.P. Morgan Chase and many others. Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again. Long way to go! Jobs Jobs Jobs!
Shifty Adam Schiff is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN and probably a very sick man. He has not paid the price yet for what he has done to our Country!
My friend Herman Cain a Powerful Voice of Freedom and all that is good passed away this morning. Herman had an incredible career and was adored by everyone that ever met him especially me. He was a very special man an American Patriot and great friend. I just got off...
The Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin is dead. She was a great woman with a wonderful gift from God her voice. She will be missed!
....a look the facts speak far louder than words! The Democrats always play the Race Card when in fact they have done so little for our Nation’s great African American people. Now lowest unemployment in U.S. history and only getting better. Elijah Cummings has failed badly!
Mini Mike Bloomberg just "quit" the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn’t have what it takes and he would have saved himself a billion dollars the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe’s campaign hoping to save face. It won’t work!
We love our Law Enforcement Officers all around this great Country. What took place in NYC with water being tossed on NYPD officers was a total disgrace. It is time for @NYCMayor @BilldeBlasio to STAND UP for those who protect our lives and serve us all so well...
.@CNN doesn’t want to speak about their persecution of General Michael Flynn & why they got the story so wrong. They along with others should pay a big price for what they have purposely done to this man & his family. They won’t even cover the big breaking news about this scam!
Sleepy Joe Biden’s 1994 Crime Bill was a total disaster. It was mass incarceration for Black people many of them innocent. I did Criminal Justice Reform something Obama & Biden didn’t even try to do - & couldn’t do even if they did try. Biden can never escape his Crime Bill!
God bless the people of El Paso Texas. God bless the people of Dayton Ohio.
Well now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!
Will be going out in 10 minutes for the press conference.
God bless the people of El Paso Texas. God bless the people of Dayton Ohio.
So funny to watch Schumer groveling. He called for the firing of bad cop James Comey many times - UNTIL I FIRED HIM!
Our great U.S. Border Patrol Agents made the biggest Fentanyl bust in our Country’s history. Thanks as always for a job well done!
So in California the Democrats who fought like crazy to get all mail in only ballots and succeeded have just opened a voting booth in the most Democrat area in the State. They are trying to steal another election. It’s all rigged out there. These votes must not count. SCAM!
Good teamwork between Republicans & Democrats as the House passes the big CoronaVirus Relief Bill. People really pulled together. Nice to see!
.....THIS SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN TO A PRESIDENT AGAIN!
...AND THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
Crazy Nancy wants to dictate terms on the Impeachment Hoax to the Republican Majority Senate but striped away all Due Process no lawyers or witnesses on the Democrat Majority House. The Dems just wish it would all end. Their case is dead their poll numbers are horrendous!
There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop. Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!
Nancy Pelosi just stated that "it is dangerous to let the voters decide Trump’s fate." @FoxNews  In other words she thinks I’m going to win and doesn’t want to take a chance on letting the voters decide. Like Al Green she wants to change our voting system. Wow she’s CRAZY!
Highly respected Senator Richard Burr head of Senate Intelligence said after interviewing over 200 witnesses and studying over 2 million pages of documents "WE HAVE FOUND NO COLLUSION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA." The Witch Hunt so bad for our Country must end!
I have retained highly respected pollster McLaughlin & Associates to analyze todays CNN Poll (and others) which I felt were FAKE based on the incredible enthusiasm we are receiving. Read analysis for yourself. This is the same thing they and others did when we defeated...
Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff! Thank you also to Chance and Dr. Darrell Scott they really get it (lowest Black & Hispanic unemployment in history).
Joe Biden has no plan for Coronavirus - ALL TALK! He was a disaster in his handling of H1N1 Swine Flu. He didn’t have a clue with his own Chief of Staff so saying. If he were in charge perhaps 2.2 million people would have died from this much more lethal disease!
When is Twitter going to allow the very popular Conservative Voices that it has so viciously shut down back into the OPEN? IT IS TIME!
DRAIN THE SWAMP!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
They asked my daughter Ivanka whether or not the media is the enemy of the people. She correctly said no. It is the FAKE NEWS which is a large percentage of the media that is the enemy of the people!
Big week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem. Congratulations to all!
Horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenseless worshipers in Egypt. The world cannot tolerate terrorism we must defeat them militarily and discredit the extremist ideology that forms the basis of their existence!
Just got recent Poll - much higher than President O at same time....Well much more has been accomplished!
FAKE NEWS - THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
As I have stated strongly before and just to reiterate if Turkey does anything that I in my great and unmatched wisdom consider to be off limits I will totally destroy and obliterate the Economy of Turkey (I’ve done before!). They must with Europe and others watch over...
A Democrat win in 2020 would be a tragic setback for African Americans! @SteveHiltonx @FoxNews
Great businessman & philanthropist Bernie Marcus Co-Founder of Home Depot said that Congress was too distracted by the (phony) Impeachment Witch Hunt when they should have been investigating  CoronaVirus when it first appeared in China. Media played a big roll also!@dcexaminer
Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border. They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead. #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess!
Heading to Arizona!
....All will stay in Mexico. If for any reason it becomes necessary we will CLOSE our Southern Border. There is no way that the United States will after decades of abuse put up with this costly and dangerous situation anymore!
PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT!
The people on the stage tonight and last were not those that will either Make America Great Again or Keep America Great! Our Country now is breaking records in almost every category from Stock Market to Military to Unemployment. We have prosperity & success like never before..
Thousand of Federal Government (delivered) Ventilators found in New York storage. N.Y. must distribute NOW!
We have to maintain strong borders or we will no longer have a country that we can be proud of – and if we show any weakness millions of people will journey into our country.
Somebody please tell incompetent (thanks for my high poll numbers) & corrupt politician Adam "Shifty" Schiff to stop leaking Classified information or even worse made up information to the Fake News Media. Someday he will be caught & that will be a very unpleasant experience!
Sincerest THANK YOU to our great Border Patrol Agent who stopped the shooter at the Synagogue in Poway California. He may have been off duty but his talents for Law Enforcement weren’t!
Space Force all the way!
The Wall is being rapidly built! The Economy is GREAT! Our Country is Respected again!
So General Flynn lies to the FBI and his life is destroyed while Crooked Hillary Clinton on that now famous FBI holiday "interrogation" with no swearing in and no recording lies many times...and nothing happens to her? Rigged system or just a double standard?
The S&P just hit an ALL TIME HIGH. This is a big win for jobs 401-K’s and frankly EVERYONE! Our Country is doing great. Even killed long sought ISIS murderer Al-Baghdadi. We are stronger than ever before with GREAT upward potential. Enjoy!
Mitt Romney never knew how to win. He is a pompous "ass" who has been fighting me from the beginning except when he begged me for my endorsement for his Senate run (I gave it to him) and when he begged me to be Secretary of State (I didn’t give it to him). He is so bad for R’s!
The African American unemployment rate fell to 6.8% the lowest rate in 45 years. I am so happy about this News! And in the Washington Post (of all places) headline states "Trumps first year jobs numbers were very very good."
Remember will be at Daytona 500 tomorrow!
54% in Poll! I would be at 75% (with our great economy maybe the best ever) if not for the Phony Witch Hunt and the Fake News Media!
Looking back into history the response by the ObamaBiden team to the H1N1 Swine Flu was considered a weak and pathetic one. Check out the polling it’s really bad. The big difference is that they got a free pass from the Corrupt Fake News Media!
We should immediately pass Voter ID @Voteridplease to insure the safety and sanctity of our voting system. Also Paper Ballots as backup (old fashioned but true!). Thank you!
When our Country had no debt and built everything from Highways to the Military with CASH we had a big system of Tariffs. Now we allow other countries to steal our wealth treasure and jobs - But no more! The USA is doing great with unlimited upside into the future!
Remember it was Buzzfeed that released the totally discredited "Dossier" paid for by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats (as opposition research) on which the entire Russian probe is based! A very sad day for journalism but a great day for our Country!
They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story found zero proof so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story. Nice
Do you believe this? The New York Times Op-Ed: MEDIA AND DEMOCRATS OWE TRUMP AN APOLOGY. Well they got that one right!
The Press has never been more dishonest than it is today. Stories are written that have absolutely no basis in fact. The writers don’t even call asking for verification. They are totally out of control. Sadly I kept many of them in business. In six years they all go BUST!
A big and beautiful day today!
For those that naively ask why didn’t the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES and they will gives us "NONE" for Border Security! Now we have to do it the hard way with a Shutdown. Too bad! @FoxNews
Have a great but very reflective President’s Day!
If Democrats want to unite around the foul language & racist hatred spewed from the mouths and actions of these very unpopular & unrepresentative Congresswomen it will be interesting to see how it plays out. I can tell you that they have made Israel feel abandoned by the U.S.
Republicans should fight very hard when it comes to state wide mail-in voting. Democrats are clamoring for it. Tremendous potential for voter fraud and for whatever reason  doesn’t work out well for Republicans. @foxandfriends
NEW RECORD FOR NASDAQ!
Pelosi & Schumer blocked desperately needed unemployment payments which is so terrible especially since they fully understand that it was not the workers fault that they are unemployed it’s the fault of China!
The United States House of Representatives has just overwhelmingly voted to kill the Resolution on Impeachment 332-95-1. This is perhaps the most ridiculous and time consuming project I have ever had to work on. Impeachment of your President who has led the....
BIGGEST TRADE DEAL EVER MADE the USMCA was signed yesterday and the Fake News Media barely mentioned it. They never thought it could be done. They have zero credibility!
After 3 1/2 years our wonderful Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be leaving the White House at the end of the month and going home to the Great State of Arkansas....
The Endless Wars Must End!
Heading to New Hampshire!
Hopefully a great successful and safe ROCKET LAUNCH. Lifting off soon!?!?  @FoxNews  @OANN
My Executive Order to protect Monuments Statues etc. IS IN FULL FORCE AND EFFECT. In excess of a 10 year prison term. Please do not put yourself in jeopardy. Many people now under arrest!
HillaryClinton can illegally get the questions to the Debate & delete 33000 emails but my son Don is being scorned by the Fake News Media?
We must not allow ISIS to return or enter our country after defeating them in the Middle East and elsewhere. Enough!
I STAND FOR LAW AND ORDER AND I TOOK ACTION! Operation LeGend has led to the arrest of over 1000 criminals including 90 killers all while Sleepy Joe Biden and the Radical Left excuses violence and crime in their Democrat-run cities. I want safety & security Joe allows CRIME!
Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment especially in swing states. 75% to 25%. Thank you!
Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell’s rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL or not to stand for the National Anthem thereby disrespecting our Country & our Flag?
White House news conference today at 5:00 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
The United States has strongly informed the President of Honduras that if the large Caravan of people heading to the U.S. is not stopped and brought back to Honduras no more money or aid will be given to Honduras effective immediately!
Crazy Bernie Sanders recently equated the City of Baltimore to a THIRD WORLD COUNTRY! Based on that statement I assume that Bernie must now be labeled a Racist just as a Republican would if he used that term and standard! The fact is Baltimore can be brought back maybe......
Leaving now for Texas!
....No matter where you may be I encourage you to turn towards prayer in an act of faith. Together we will easily PREVAIL!
The only way to stop drugs gangs human trafficking criminal elements and much else from coming into our Country is with a Wall or Barrier. Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!
....of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!
Seriously failed presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren just introduced an Amendment on the renaming of many of our legendary Military Bases from which we trained to WIN two World Wars. Hopefully our great Republican Senators won’t fall for this!
Wow Bernie is unwilling to give up his delegates and wants more of them! What’s that all about?
With what I am doing in the fight with the Drug Companies drug prices will be coming down 50 60 and even 70 per cent. The Democrats are fighting hard to stop me with big ad buys plus. Likewise Big Pharma. FAVORED NATIONS AND REBATES ARE BRINGING PRICES DOWN NOW. We will win!
The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught called out and fired. How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend Terry M who was also under investigation? How many lies? How many leaks? Comey knew it all and much more!
Sleepy Joe Biden was in charge of the H1N1 Swine Flu epidemic which killed thousands of people. The response was one of the worst on record. Our response is one of the best with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating the highest on record. His was lowest!
We pass 15000000 Tests Today by far the most in the World. Open Safely!
Once again Sleepy Joe told the press they could go home at 9 A.M. Meanwhile your Favorite President me will go to Reno Nevada tonight three stops in Las Vegas tomorrow with California and Arizona on schedule Monday. Don’t worry we won’t be taking off Tuesday either!
Congratulations to Bibi @Netanyahu on becoming the longest serving PM in the history of Israel. Under your leadership Israel has become a technology powerhouse and a world class economy....
....victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you
....untruthful slime ball who was as time has proven a terrible Director of the FBI. His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case and the events surrounding it will go down as one of the worst "botch jobs" of history. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!
Mexico was just ranked the second deadliest country in the world after only Syria. Drug trade is largely the cause. We will BUILD THE WALL!
So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson. This is just one of many such preventable tragedies. We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border and with illegal immigration FAST!
"The Democrats want to run a Country and they can’t run a Caucus." Brad Blakeman @FoxNews  Iowa is a complete disaster for the Dems. They should bring in Mini Mike Bloomberg ASAP!
Poll: Trump Better Than Biden On Economic Growth 55% to 34%. That’s all? Who are the 34%?
...The Steel Barrier or Wall should have been built by previous administrations long ago. They never got it done - I will. Without it our Country cannot be safe. Criminals Gangs Human Traffickers Drugs & so much other big trouble can easily pour in. It can be stopped cold!
I hope all Republican House Members vote NO on FISA until such time as our Country is able to determine how and why the greatest political criminal and subversive scandal in USA history took place!
Many Gang Members and some very bad people are mixed into the Caravan heading to our Southern Border. Please go back you will not be admitted into the United States unless you go through the legal process. This is an invasion of our Country and our Military is waiting for you!
Why should I as President of the United States allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses as they have for decades while our Farmers Workers & Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay? Not fair to the PEOPLE of America! $800 Billion Trade Deficit...
So many amazing things happened over the last three days. All or at least most of those things are great for the United States. Much was accomplished!
The United States has paid Iraq Billions of Dollars a year for many years. That is on top of all else we have done for them. The people of Iraq don’t want to be dominated & controlled by Iran but ultimately that is their choice. Over the last 15 years Iran has gained more....
With Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country Republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for STRONG Border Security. Dems do nothing. If there is no Wall there is no Security. Human Trafficking Drugs and Criminals of all dimensions - KEEP OUT!
VIRGINIA and everywhere else for that matter I am the only thing standing between you and your 2nd Amendment. If I am re-elected it is 100% SAFE. If not it is GONE!
My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom. She is a great person -- always pushing me to do the right thing! Terrible!
Wow so many lies by now disgraced acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe. He was fired for lying and now his story gets even more deranged. He and Rod Rosenstein who was hired by Jeff Sessions (another beauty) look like they were planning a very illegal act and got caught.....
Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana a true friend and patriot was badly injured but will fully recover. Our thoughts and prayers are with him.
Interesting? By Congress not wanting the special 5 minute testing apparatus they are saying that they are not "essential".  In any event we have great testing capacity and have performed 6.5 million tests which is more than every country in the world combined!
Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S. We will now begin cutting off or substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them.
Little Adam Schiff who is desperate to run for higher office is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington right up there with Comey Warner Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!
The Gallup Poll just announced that 69% of our great citizens expect their finances to improve next year a 16 year high. Nice!
Tremendous numbers of people are coming up through Mexico in the hopes of flooding our Southern Border. We have sent additional military. We will build a Human Wall if necessary. If we had a real Wall this would be a non-event!
Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heal & we will heal & be stronger than ever before!
Governor Cuomo should spend more time "doing" and less time "complaining". Get out there and get the job done. Stop talking! We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn’t need or use gave large numbers of Ventilators that you should have had and helped you with....
Senator Richard Blumenthal must talk about his fraudulent service in Vietnam where for 12 years he told the people of Connecticut as their Attorney General that he was a great Marine War Hero. Talked about his many battles of near death but was never in Vietnam. Total Phony!
The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. We must protect our Country at all cost!
Just had a long and very good call with President Xi of China. Deal is moving along very well. If made it will be very comprehensive covering all subjects areas and points of dispute. Big progress being made!
I believe it will be Crazy Bernie Sanders vs. Sleepy Joe Biden as the two finalists to run against maybe the best Economy in the history of our Country (and MANY other great things)! I look forward to facing whoever it may be. May God Rest Their Soul!
"Nancy Pelosi all of a sudden doesn’t like the payroll tax cut but when Obama proposed it she thought it was a brilliant thing that all of the working families would benefit from because if you get a paycheck you’re going to take home more money." @kilmeade @foxandfriends
"11000 points gained in the Dow in the 3 years since the Election of President Trump. Today it may hit 29000. That has NEVER happened before in that time frame. That has added 12.8 Trillion Dollars to the VALUE of American Business." @Varneyco @FoxNews  The best is yet to come!
My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina. Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they’ve done!
The Trump Administration has accomplished more than any other U.S. Administration in its first two (not even) years of existence & we are having a great time doing it! All of this despite the Fake News Media which has gone totally out of its mind-truly the Enemy of the People!
This memo totally vindicates "Trump" in probe. But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on. Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING collusion is dead). This is an American disgrace!
The U.S. is working very closely with the Government of Thailand to help get all of the children out of the cave and to safety. Very brave and talented people!
Shifty Schiff a totally corrupt politician made up a horrible and fraudulent statement read it to Congress and said those words came from me. He got caught was very embarrassed yet nothing happened to him for committing this fraud. He’ll eventually have to answer for this!
Up BIG in South Carolina!
Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll much higher than President Obama at same point. With all of the phony stories and Fake News it’s hard to believe! Thank you America we are doing Great Things.
They are taking the nomination away from Bernie for a second time. Rigged!
58000 non-citizens voted in Texas with 95000 non-citizens registered to vote. These numbers are just the tip of the iceberg. All over the country especially in California voter fraud is rampant. Must be stopped. Strong voter ID! @foxandfriends
To Tim: The Button on the IPhone was FAR better than the Swipe!
Why aren’t they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show? A total double standard but that’s O.K. we are Winning and will be doing so for a long time to come!
All levels of government and Law Enforcement are watching carefully for VOTER FRAUD including during EARLY VOTING. Cheat at your own peril. Violators will be subject to maximum penalties both civil and criminal!
China has agreed to reduce and remove tariffs on cars coming into China from the U.S. Currently the tariff is 40%.
Alec Baldwin whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL now says playing me was agony. Alec it was agony for those who were forced to watch. Bring back Darrell Hammond funnier and a far greater talent!
I cannot believe the level of dishonesty in the media. It is totally out of control but we are winning!
Beto (phony name to indicate Hispanic heritage) O’Rourke who is embarrassed by my last visit to the Great State of Texas where I trounced him and is now even more embarrassed by polling at 1% in the Democrat Primary should respect the victims & law enforcement - & be quiet!
Republicans must state loudly and clearly that WE are going to provide much better Healthcare at a much lower cost. Get the word out! Will always protect pre-existing conditions!!!
The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill. Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed. Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote. If approved there will be a News Conference at The White House at approximately 1:00 P.M.

Our Nation was founded by farmers. Our independence was won by farmers. And our continent was tamed by farmers. Our farmers always lead the way -- we are PROUD of them and we are DELIVERING for them! #NationalAgricultureDay

If you like automobiles how can you vote for a Democrat who all want to get rid of cars as quickly as possible especially if they are powered by gasoline. Remember also no more than one car per family. I on the other hand have new plants being built all over Michigan Plus!
Congratulations to Randy Feenstra on your big win in the Iowa Republican Primary. You will be a great Congressman!
Was Andy McCabe ever forced to pay back the $700000 illegally given to him and his wife for his wife’s political campaign by Crooked Hillary Clinton while Hillary was under FBI investigation and McCabe was the head of the FBI??? Just askin’?
Last month all you heard from the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats was "Ventilators Ventilators Ventilators." They screamed it loud & clear & thought they had us cold even though it was the State’s task. But everyone got their V’s with many to spare. Now they scream....
With approximately 100000 CoronaVirus cases worldwide and 3280 deaths the United States because of quick action on closing our borders has as of now only 129 cases (40 Americans brought in) and 11 deaths. We are working very hard to keep these numbers as low as possible!
Can you believe that with all of the made up unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media together with the  $10000000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion) I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year. Much of the Media may be corrupt but the People truly get it!
At the request of the Governor of Texas I have signed the Disaster Proclamation which unleashes the full force of government help!
Watching @FoxNews on weekend afternoons is a total waste of time. We now have some great alternatives like @OANN.
Just returned to Washington from France and the very successful G-7 only to find that the Fake News is still trying to perpetuate the phony story that I wanted to use Nuclear weapons to blow up hurricanes before they reach shore. This is so ridiculous never happened!
Only the Fake News Media and Trump enemies want me to stop using Social Media (110 million people). Only way for me to get the truth out!
Because the "Ratings" of my News Conferences etc. are so high "Bachelor finale Monday Night Football type numbers" according to the @nytimes the Lamestream Media is going CRAZY. "Trump is reaching too many people we must stop him." said one lunatic. See you at 5:00 P.M.!
Oh no the Dems are worried again. The only one that can kill this comeback is Sleepy Joe Biden!
Just landed in Mankato Minnesota!
Jobs are returning illegal immigration is plummeting law order and justice are being restored. We are truly making America great again!
Great News: The boring but very nasty magazine The Atlantic is rapidly failing going down the tubes and has just been forced to announce it is laying off at least 20% of its staff in order to limp into the future. This is a tough time to be in the Fake News Business!
How do you get Impeached when you have done NOTHING wrong (a perfect call) have created the best economy in the history of our Country rebuilt our Military fixed the V.A. (Choice!) cut Taxes & Regs protected your 2nd A created Jobs Jobs Jobs and soooo much more? Crazy!

Few people know where they’ll be in two years from now but I do in the Great State of Alaska (which I love) campaigning against Senator Lisa Murkowski. She voted against HealthCare Justice Kavanaugh and much else...
When are the thugs looters and anarchists moving out of the so-called "Autonomous Zone" in Seattle? Get going!
"Donald Trump was being framed he fought back. That is not Obstruction." @JesseBWatters  I had the right to end the whole Witch Hunt if I wanted. I could have fired everyone including Mueller if I wanted. I chose not to. I had the RIGHT to use Executive Privilege. I didn’t!
....Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP. Does anybody believe that makes sense? We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade. Change is coming!
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out & we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!
Seattle Looters Agitators Anarchists and "Protestors" are now refusing to leave the "CHOP" Zone. They have ZERO respect for Government or the Mayor of Seattle or Governor of Washington State! Not good!
Mexico is doing NOTHING to stop the Caravan which is now fully formed and heading to the United States. We stopped the last two - many are still in Mexico but can’t get through our Wall but it takes a lot of Border Agents if there is no Wall. Not easy!
Stock Market up almost 40% since the Election with 7 Trillion Dollars of U.S. value built throughout the economy. Lowest unemployment rate in many decades with Black & Hispanic unemployment lowest in History and Female unemployment lowest in 21 years. Highest confidence ever!
The Fake Mainstream Media has from the time I announced I was running for President run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics. No matter how well WE do they find fault. But the forgotten men & women WON I’m President!
FBI & DOJ to review the outrageous Jussie Smollett case in Chicago. It is an embarrassment to our Nation!
As we celebrate LGBT Pride Month and recognize the outstanding contributions LGBT people have made to our great Nation let us also stand in solidarity with the many LGBT people who live in dozens of countries worldwide that punish imprison or even execute individuals....
....Does anyone ever notice how few quotes from an actual person are given nowadays by the Lamestream Media. Very seldom. The unnamed or anonymous sources are almost always FAKE NEWS.
Wow! A federal Judge in the Southern District of N.Y. completely dismissed a lawsuit brought by the Democratic National Committee against our historic 2016 campaign for President. The Judge said the DNC case was "entirely divorced" from the facts yet another total & complete....
The States have to step up their TESTING!
The Ballots being returned to States cannot be accurately counted. Many things are already going very wrong!
Avenatti is a third rate lawyer who is good at making false accusations like he did on me and like he is now doing on Judge Brett Kavanaugh. He is just looking for attention and doesn’t want people to look at his past record and relationships - a total low-life!
To any of the pundits or talking heads that do not give us proper credit for this great Midterm Election just remember two words - FAKE NEWS!
The decision on Sergeant Bergdahl is a complete and total disgrace to our Country and to our Military.
Thank you to @foxandfriends for covering supremely the greatest political scandal in the history of the United States OBAMAGATE. Fake News @CNN and Concast’s own MSDNC are only trying to make their 3 year Con Job just go away. They are embarrassed and don’t know what to do....

"These guys the investigators ought to be in jail. What they have done working with the Obama intelligence agencies is simply unprecedented. This is one of the greatest political hoaxes ever perpetrated on the people of this Country and Mueller is a coverup."  Rush Limbaugh
Don’t forget we are building and renovating big sections of Wall right now. Moving quickly and will cost far less than previous politicians thought possible. Building after all is what I do best even when money is not readily available!
NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS!
China gets 91% of its Oil from the Straight Japan 62% & many other countries likewise. So why are we protecting the shipping lanes for other countries (many years) for zero compensation. All of these countries should be protecting their own ships on what has always been....

Every time you see a Caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our Country illegally think of and blame the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic Immigration Laws! Remember the Midterms! So unfair to those who come in legally.
"President Donald J. Trump is the greatest hostage negotiator that I know of in the history of the United States. 20 hostages many in impossible circumstances have been released in last two years. No money was paid." Cheif Hostage Negotiator USA!
Many people booed the players who kneeled yesterday (which was a small percentage of total). These are fans who demand respect for our Flag!
Nancy Pelosi just got duped in an interview to admitting that she has been working on impeaching me for "two and a half years." In other words she lied. This was the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats plan all along long before the Ukraine phone call. Impeachment Hoax!
"About 500000 human beings were killed in Syria while Barack Obama was president & leading for a "political settlement" to that civil war. Media has been more outraged in the last 72 hours over our Syria policy than they were at any point during 7 years of slaughter." BuckSexton
JUST OUT: 3.9% Unemployment. 4% is Broken! In the meantime WITCH HUNT!
I love the White House one of the most beautiful buildings (homes) I have ever seen. But Fake News said I called it a dump - TOTALLY UNTRUE
THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN (We will never forget)!
We have just purchased many Ventilators from some wonderful companies. Names and numbers will be announced later today!
....The fact is that African/American unemployment is now the lowest in the history of our country. Same with Asian Hispanic and almost every other group. The Democrats have been all talk and no action. My Administration has already produced like no other and everyone sees it!
I will be doing a major Fake @NBCNews Town Hall Forum live tonight from Miami at 8:00 P.M. They asked me to do it in place of the Rigged Steve Scully (he is now suspended from @cspan for lying) Debate. I wonder if they’ll treat me as well as Sleepy Joe? They should!
The Paris Agreement isn’t working out so well for Paris. Protests and riots all over France. People do not want to pay large sums of money much to third world countries (that are questionably run) in order to maybe protect the environment. Chanting "We Want Trump!" Love France.
Where’s the Fake Whistleblower? Where’s Whistleblower number 2? Where’s the phony informer who got it all wrong?
Thank you to the great Republican Senators who showed up to our mtg on immigration reform. We must BUILD THE WALL stop illegal immigration end chain migration & cancel the visa lottery. The current system is unsafe & unfair to the great people of our country - time for change!

Wow looks like James Comey exonerated Hillary Clinton long before the investigation was over...and so much more. A rigged system!
Sleepy Joe Biden has spent 47 years in politics being terrible to Hispanics. Now he is relying on Castro lover Bernie Sanders to help him out. That won’t work! Remember Miami Cubans gave me the highly honored Bay of Pigs Award for all I have done for our great Cuban Population!
Big announcement today: Drug companies have to come clean about their prices in TV ads. Historic transparency for American patients is here. If drug companies are ashamed of those prices—lower them!
Despite the disgusting illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U.S. history - by far! Sorry to the Fake News Media and "Haters" but that’s the way it is!
"President Trump champions American greatness in his Mount Rushmore speech." @seanhannity @FoxNews
Would Chris Cuomo be given a Red Flag for his recent rant? Filthy language and a total loss of control. He shouldn’t be allowed to have any weapon. He’s nuts!
JOBLESS CLAIMS AT 50 YEAR LOW!
The Greatest Economy in American History!
The Iran sanctions have officially been cast. These are the most biting sanctions ever imposed and in November they ratchet up to yet another level. Anyone doing business with Iran will NOT be doing business with the United States. I am asking for WORLD PEACE nothing less!
AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD. Great job by law enforcement and all concerned!
The United States of America will NOT be cutting funding to @starsandstripes magazine under my watch. It will continue to be a wonderful source of information to our Great Military!
I will represent our country well and fight for its interests! Fake News Media will never cover me accurately but who cares! We will #MAGA!
Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation. Some are true and some are false. Some are old and some are new. There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone. Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process?
Prime Minister of the United Kingdom @BorisJohnson stated "We should replace the Iran deal with the Trump deal." I agree!
So if African-American unemployment is now at the lowest number in history median income the highest and you then add all of the other things I have done how do Democrats who have done NOTHING for African-Americans but TALK win the Black Vote?  And it will only get better!
Remember when Pelosi was screaming that President Trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly. They didn’t get one Republican House vote and lost 3 Dems. They produced no case so now she doesn’t want to go to the Senate. She’s all lies. Most overrated person I know!
We’ve done a GREAT job on Covid response making all Governors look good some fantastic (and that’s OK) but the Lamestream Media doesn’t want to go with that narrative and the Do Nothing Dems talking point is to say only bad about "Trump". I made everybody look good but me!
I just approved an expedited request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of California. Wanted to respond quickly in order to alleviate some of the incredible suffering going on. I am with you all the way. God Bless all of the victims and families affected.
The Dems were trying to distance themselves from the four "progressives" but now they are forced to embrace them. That means they are endorsing Socialism hate of Israel and the USA! Not good for the Democrats!
My Campaign for President was conclusively spied on. Nothing like this has ever happened in American Politics. A really bad situation. TREASON means long jail sentences and this was TREASON!
So great to watch & listen to all these people who write books & talk about my presidential campaign and so many others things related to winning and how I should be doing "IT." As I take it all in I then sit back look around & say "gee I’m in the White House & they’re not!
Despite the most hostile and corrupt media in the history of American politics the Trump Administration has accomplished more in its first two years than any other Administration. Judges biggest Tax & Regulation Cuts V.A. Choice Best Economy Lowest Unemployment & much more!
Big news - Budget just passed!
Stock Market hit all time high on Friday. Congratulations U.S.A.!
I know many in business and politics that work out endlessly in some cases to a point of exhaustion. It is their number one passion in life but nobody complains. My "exercise" is playing almost never during the week a quick round of golf. Obama played more and much longer....
The Democrats will never be satisfied no matter what they get how much they get or how many pages they get. It will never end but that’s the way life goes!
When I looked up to the sky and jokingly said "I am the chosen one" at a press conference two days ago referring to taking on Trade with China little did I realize that the media would claim that I had a "Messiah complex." They knew I was kidding being sarcastic and just....
Mini Mike Bloomberg’s debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates and there have been some really bad ones. He was stumbling bumbling and grossly incompetent. If this doesn’t knock him out of the race nothing will. Not so easy to do what I did!
.....shouting of the F...word among many other terrible things and the petrified Dems run for the hills. Why isn’t the House voting to rebuke the filthy and hate laced things they have said? Because they are the Radical Left and the Democrats are afraid to take them on. Sad!
Colin Powell was a pathetic interview today on Fake News CNN. In his time he was weak & gave away everything to everybody - so bad for the USA. Also got the "weapons of mass destruction" totally wrong and you know what that mistake cost us? Sad! Only negative questions asked.
The riots in Charlottesville a year ago resulted in senseless death and division. We must come together as a nation. I condemn all types of racism and acts of violence. Peace to ALL Americans!
Fire at Trump Tower is out. Very confined (well built building). Firemen (and women) did a great job. THANK YOU!
Great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. Only Russia Russia Russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is No Collusion!
It was great meeting some of our outstanding young military personnel who were wounded in both Syria and Afghanistan. Their wounds are deep but their spirit is sooo high. They will recoverer & be back very soon. America loves them. Walter Reed Hospital is AMAZING - Thank you all!
Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to and happened with the illegal attempted "coup" of the duly elected President of the United States and others!
Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Tester’s statements on Admiral Jackson are not true. There were no such findings. A horrible thing that we in D.C. must live with just like phony Russian Collusion. Tester should lose race in Montana. Very dishonest and sick!

Shoplifting is a very big deal in China as it should be (5-10 years in jail) but not to father LaVar. Should have gotten his son out during my next trip to China instead. China told them why they were released. Very ungrateful!
I would be willing to "shut down" government if the Democrats do not give us the votes for Border Security which includes the Wall! Must get rid of Lottery Catch & Release etc. and finally go to system of Immigration based on MERIT! We need great people coming into our Country!
I am running for re-election to bring prosperity to Nevada to put violent criminals behind bars and to ensure the future belongs to AMERICA—NOT China. If we win AMERICA WINS! If Biden wins China wins. If Biden Wins the rioters anarchists and arsonists win. VOTE! #MAGA
While I like the Vaping alternative to Cigarettes we need to make sure this alternative is SAFE for ALL! Let’s get counterfeits off the market and keep young children from Vaping!
I inherited a total mess in Syria and Afghanistan the "Endless Wars" of unlimited spending and death. During my campaign I said very strongly that these wars must finally end. We spend $50 Billion a year in Afghanistan and have hit them so hard that we are now talking peace...
....As proven last week during a Congressional tour the Border is clean efficient & well run just very crowded. Cumming District is a disgusting rat and rodent infested mess. If he spent more time in Baltimore maybe he could help clean up this very dangerous & filthy place
Drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing. Not being fair to the consumer or to our Country!

I have asked Secretary of State @SecPompeo to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. "South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers." @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews
While in the Philippines I was forced to watch @CNN which I have not done in months and again realized how bad and FAKE it is. Loser!
Presidential Approval numbers are very good - strong economy military and just about everything else. Better numbers than Obama at this point by far. We are winning on just about every front and for that reason there will not be a Blue Wave but there might be a Red Wave!
...Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!
Looks like Bob Mueller’s team of 13 Trump Haters & Angry Democrats are illegally leaking information to the press while the Fake News Media make up their own stories with or without sources - sources no longer matter to our corrupt & dishonest Mainstream Media they are a Joke!
Working closely with China and others on Coronavirus outbreak. Only 5 people in U.S. all in good recovery.
The only Collusion with the Russians was with Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee...And where’s the Server that the DNC refused to give to the FBI?  Where are the new Texts between Agent Lisa Page and her Agent lover Peter S? We want them now!
Heading to Kenosha Wisconsin to thank Law Enforcement and the National Guard for a job well done. The Violence stopped six days ago the moment the Guard entered the picture. Thank you!

SLEEPY JOE BIDEN IS PROPOSING THE BIGGEST TAX HIKE IN OUR COUNTRY’S HISTORY! CAN ANYBODY REALLY VOTE FOR THIS?
Congratulations to our great military men and women for representing the United States and the world so well in the Syria attack.
Wishing @FLOTUS Melania and all of the great mothers out there a wonderful day ahead with family and friends! Happy #MothersDay
...Remember this. Throughout the ages some things NEVER get better and NEVER change. You have Walls and you have Wheels. It was ALWAYS that way and it will ALWAYS be that way! Please explain to the Democrats that there can NEVER be a replacement for a good old fashioned WALL!
So sad that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer will never be able to see or understand the great promise of our Country. They can continue the Witch Hunt which has already cost $40M and been a tremendous waste of time and energy for everyone in America or get back to work....
Joe Biden’s handling of the H1N1 Swine Flu was a complete and total disaster. Even polls on the matter were terrible!

I asked @VP Pence to leave stadium if any players kneeled disrespecting our country. I am proud of him and @SecondLady Karen.
So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris. At some point countries will have to open their eyes & see what is really going on. This kind of sickness & hatred is not compatible with a loving peaceful & successful country! Changes to our thought process on terror must be made.
So Biden is coughing and hacking and playing "fingers" with his mask all over the place and the Fake News doesn’t want to even think about discussing it. "Journalism" has reached the all time low in history. Sadly Lamestream knows this and doesn’t even care!
Today I opened a major Apple Manufacturing plant in Texas that will bring high paying jobs back to America. Today Nancy Pelosi closed Congress because she doesn’t care about American Workers!
....invited Megan or the team but I am now inviting the TEAM win or lose. Megan should never disrespect our Country the White House or our Flag especially since so much has been done for her & the team. Be proud of the Flag that you wear. The USA is doing GREAT!
We have today informed the countries of Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador that if they allow their citizens or others to journey through their borders and up to the United States with the intention of entering our country illegally all payments made to them will STOP (END)!
I hardly know Cindy McCain other than having put her on a Committee at her husband’s request. Joe Biden was John McCain’s lapdog. So many BAD decisions on Endless Wars & the V.A. which I brought from a horror show to HIGH APPROVAL. Never a fan of John. Cindy can have Sleepy Joe!
The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now and they are fully aware of what that entails. The Democrats are moving slowly all over the USA for political purposes. They would wait until November 3rd if it were up to them. Don’t play politics. Be safe move quickly!
Law Enforcement is looking into another big corruption scandal having to do with Election Fraud in #Broward and Palm Beach. Florida voted for Rick Scott!
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is saying privately that the new China Trade Deal is  unbelievable which it is but publicly he knocks it whenever possible. That’s politics but so bad for our great Country!
How does the Fake News not include Online Streaming Numbers where Republicans blow the Dem Numbers away?
Why is the World Bank loaning money to China? Can this be possible? China has plenty of money and if they don’t they create it. STOP!

Our country’s great First Lady Melania is doing really well in Africa. The people love her and she loves them! It is a beautiful thing to see.
...I do not tolerate ANY extreme violence. Defending ALL Americans even those who oppose and attack me is what I will always do as your President! Governor Whitmer—open up your state open up your schools and open up your churches!
....or is he too dumb (stupid} to understand that. No wonder CNN’s ratings (MSNBC’s also) have gone down the tubes - and will stay there until they bring credibility back to the newsroom. Don’t hold your breath!
KOREAN WAR TO END! The United States and all of its GREAT people should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea!
I would like to thank the President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and his foreign minister Marcelo Ebrard together with all of the many representatives of both the United States and Mexico for working so long and hard to get our agreement on immigration completed!
Cheating on Unsolicited Ballots by political hacks or anyone else is against the law. We are closely watching!
Where is the Whistleblower and why did he or she write such a fictitious and incorrect account of my phone call with the Ukrainian President? Why did the IG allow this to happen? Who is the so-called Informant (Schiff?) who was so inaccurate? A giant Scam!
Where’s the Whistleblower?
It's very sad that Republicans even some that were carried over the line on my back do very little to protect their President.
....be put in use IMMEDIATELY. PEOPLE ARE DYING MOVE FAST and GOD BLESS EVERYONE! @US_FDA @SteveFDA @CDCgov @DHSgov
President Obama thought that Crooked Hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian Meddling he said it couldn’t happen was no big deal & did NOTHING about it. When I won it became a big deal and the Rigged Witch Hunt headed by Strzok!
The Atlantic Magazine is dying like most magazines so they make up a fake story in order to gain some relevance. Story already refuted but this is what we are up against. Just like the Fake Dossier. You fight and and fight and then people realize it was a total fraud!
Hundreds of Bikers for Trump just joined me at Bedminster. Quite a scene - great people who truly love our Country!
"We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected undocumented unchecked..." Barrack Obama 2005. I voted when I was a Senator to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in..." Hillary Clinton 2015.

The Do Nothing Democrats just keep repeating and repeating over and over again the same old "stuff" on the Impeachment Hoax. They want to use up ALL of their time even though it is the wrong thing to do. They ought to go back to work for our great American people!
Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for everyone including Republicans Democrats and DACA but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. Should be able to get there. See you at the negotiating table!
Republicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices. We will strongly regulate or close them down before we can ever allow this to happen. We saw what they attempted to do and failed in 2016. We can’t let a more sophisticated version of that....
So much Fake News. Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate. But through it all our country is doing great!
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!
Russia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from Venezuela.
Representative Devin Nunes a man of tremendous courage and grit may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!
Tremendous progress being made on Vaccines and Therapeutics!!!
I don’t know the so-called Whistleblower Rick Bright never met him or even heard of him but to me he is a disgruntled employee not liked or respected by people I spoke to and who with his attitude should no longer be working for our government!
Congratulations to a truly great football team the Clemson Tigers on an incredible win last night against a powerful Alabama team. A big win also for the Great State of South Carolina. Look forward to seeing the team and their brilliant coach for the second time at the W.H.
The Liberal Left also known as the Democrats want to get rid of ICE who do a fantastic job and want Open Borders. Crime would be rampant and uncontrollable! Make America Great Again
Great News! Randall Stephenson the CEO of heavily indebted AT&T which owns and presides over Fake News @CNN is leaving or was forced out. Anyone who lets a garbage "network" do and say the things that CNN does should leave ASAP. Hopefully replacement will be much better!
The cages for kids were built by the Obama Administration in 2014. He had the policy of child separation. I ended it even as I realized that more families would then come to the Border! @CNN
New papers make CLEAR that the Obama Administration SPIED in an unprecedented manner on the Trump Campaign and beyond and even on the United States Senate. Nobody would ever have believed that this level of illegality and corruption would be taking place in our beautiful USA!
Nervous Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace to herself and her family for having made such a disgusting statement especially since I was with foreign leaders overseas. There is no evidence for such a thing to have been said. Nervous Nancy & Dems are getting Zero work done in Congress....
Nancy Pelosi couldn’t care less about the American People or the great American Worker. She should approve needed STIMULUS now. Most other Dems agree. Republicans are ready to go I am ready to sign!!!
New Stock Market Record today AGAIN. Congratulations USA!
Wow but not surprisingly ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!
The Fake News Media has NEVER been more Dishonest or Corrupt than it is right now. There has never been a time like this in American History. Very exciting but also very sad! Fake News is the absolute Enemy of the People and our Country itself!
So funny to see little Adam Schitt (D-CA) talking about the fact that Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker was not approved by the Senate but not mentioning the fact that Bob Mueller (who is highly conflicted) was not approved by the Senate!
Congratulations to Attorney General Bill Barr for taking charge of a case that was totally out of control and perhaps should not have even been brought. Evidence now clearly shows that the Mueller Scam was improperly brought & tainted. Even Bob Mueller lied to Congress!
STOCK MARKET UP ANOTHER 300 POINTS - GREATEST LEADING INDICATOR OF THEM ALL!!! DON’T RUIN IT WITH SLEEPY JOE!!!
"Democrat Texas Congressman Al Green says impeachment is the only thing that can prevent President Trump from re-election in 2020." @OANN  In other words Dems can’t win the election fairly. You can’t impeach a president for creating the best economy in our country’s history.....
If the U.S. sells a car into China there is a tax of 25%. If China sells a car into the U.S. there is a tax of 2%. Does anybody think that is FAIR? The days of the U.S. being ripped-off by other nations is OVER!
I am pleased to inform the American Public that Acting Secretary Chad Wolf will be nominated to be the Secretary of Homeland Security. Chad has done an outstanding job and we greatly appreciate his service!
I am ready to send more money to States and Local governments to save jobs for Police Fire Fighters First Responders and Teachers. DEMOCRATS ARE HOLDING THIS UP!
Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release. Getting more dangerous. "Caravans" coming. Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW. NO MORE DACA DEAL!
As I predicted all along Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy get it done!
New Poll: The Rasmussen Poll one of the most accurate in predicting the 2016 Election has just announced that "Trump" numbers have recently gone up by four points to 50%. Thank you to the vicious young Socialist Congresswomen. America will never buy your act!  #MAGA2020
....Greatest Economic BOOM in the history of our Country the best job numbers biggest tax reduction rebuilt military and much more is now OVER. This should never be allowed to happen to another President of the United States again!
Getting ready to land in Johnstown Pennsylvania. Big crowd. See you soon!!!
"There’s not one shred of evidence that this president’s done anything Constitutionally (or anything else) wrong." Graham Ledger.  Thank you Graham so true!
Despite the tremendous success that I have had as President including perhaps the greatest ECONOMY and most successful first two years of any President in history they have stolen two years of my (our) Presidency (Collusion Delusion) that we will never be able to get back.....
My lawyers should sue the Democrats and Shifty Adam Schiff for fraud!
....Border is eventually going to be militarized and defended or the United States as we have known it is going to cease to exist...And Americans will not go gentle into that good night. Patrick Buchanan.  The great people of our Country demand proper Border Security NOW!
No Collusion - No Obstruction!
....visible members of the House Democrats who are now wedded to this bitterness and hate. The Republican vote was 187-4. Wow! Also this was the first time since 1984 that the Speaker of the House was ruled Out of Order and broke the Rules of the House. Quite a day!
Everybody is now acknowledging that right from the time I announced my run for President I was 100% correct on the Border. Remember the heat I took? Democrats should now get rid of the loopholes. The Border is being fixed. Mexico will not let people through!
The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens. Not good!
The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them they have gone crazy. Therefore I say if you are going to impeach me do it now fast so we can have a fair....
"Cities across the Nation that are run by Democrats are in shambles." Matt Walsh  @TuckerCarlson
The terrorist came into our country through what is called the "Diversity Visa Lottery Program" a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based.
Remember Sunday is National Prayer Day (by Presidential Proclamation)!
African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country. The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history. Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!  #NeverForget  @foxandfriends
I’d like to thank all of the Great Republican Senators who bravely voted for Strong Border Security and the WALL. This will help stop Crime Human Trafficking and Drugs entering our Country. Watch when you get back to your State they will LOVE you more than ever before!
The Democrats and the Fake News are trying to make terrorist Soleimani into a wonderful guy only because I did what should have been done for 20 years. Anything I do whether it’s the economy military or anything else will be scorned by the Rafical Left Do Nothing Democrats!
Big Pharma is taking ads against me because I am MASSIVELY lowering your drug prices which is obviously not good for them. Medicare premiums will also be going down. I am the first President to take them on. Don’t fall for their false ads. Biden plan is for very big increases!
Based on Justin’s false statements at his news conference and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U.S. farmers workers and companies I have instructed our U.S. Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U.S. Market!
The Wall Street Journal always "forgets" to mention that the ratings for the White House Press Briefings are "through the roof" (Monday Night Football Bachelor Finale according to @nytimes) & is only way for me to escape the Fake News & get my views across. WSJ is Fake News!
Border Patrol and Law Enforcement has apprehended (captured) large numbers of illegal immigrants at the Border. They won’t be coming into the U.S. The Wall is being built and will greatly help us in the future and now!
Just spoke to my friend President Joko Widodo of the Republic of Indonesia. Asking for Ventilators which we will provide. Great cooperation between us!
Have the Democrats finally realized that we desperately need Border Security and a Wall on the Southern Border. Need to stop Drugs Human TraffickingGang Members & Criminals from coming into our Country. Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?
We have the greatest economy anywhere in the world. We have the greatest military anywhere in the world. Not bad!
Can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the Fake News Media (should be getting good stories) today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers including those on Election Day? The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press. Make America Great Again!
....People their VOTE their Freedoms their Second Amendment Religion Military Border Wall and their God-given rights as a Citizen of The United States of America!
There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people anyone.....
Well the Special Elections are over and those that want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN are 5 and O! All the Fake News all the money spent = 0
Where is the Fake Whistleblower?
When are the Fake Journalists who received unwarranted Pulitzer Prizes for Russia Russia Russia and the Impeachment Scam going to turn in their tarnished awards so they can be given to the real journalists who got it right. I’ll give you the names there are plenty of them!
Washed up psycho @BetteMidler was forced to apologize for a statement she attributed to me that turned out to be totally fabricated by her in order to make "your great president" look really bad. She got caught just like the Fake News Media gets caught. A sick scammer!
A vote for Democrats in November is a vote to let MS-13 run wild in our communities to let drugs pour into our cities and to take jobs and benefits away from hardworking Americans. Democrats want anarchy amnesty and chaos - Republicans want LAW ORDER and JUSTICE!
At some point the Fake News will be forced to discuss our great jobs numbers strong economy success with ISIS the border & so much else!
The Democrats don’t want to approve more money for our great workers under the incredibly successful "Paycheck" plan. Replenish Account Now!
The Democrats want Billions of Dollars for Foreign Aid but they don’t want to spend a small fraction of that number on properly securing our Border. Figure that one out!
The Fake News Media refuses to discuss how good the Economy and Stock Market including JOBS under the Trump Administration are doing. We will soon be in RECORD TERRITORY. All they want to discuss is COVID 19 where they won’t say it but we beat the Dems all day long also!!!
The hearing of Peter Strzok and the other hating frauds at the FBI & DOJ should be shown to the public on live television not a closed door hearing that nobody will see. We should expose these people for what they are - there should be total transparency!
Another terrorist attack in London...These animals are crazy and must be dealt with through toughness and strength!
Funny to hear the Democrats talking about the National Debt when President Obama doubled it in only 8 years!
We are acting as a police force not the fighting force that we are in Afghanistan. After 19 years it is time for them to police their own Country. Bring our soldiers back home but closely watch what is going on and strike with a thunder like never before if necessary!
In a letter to her House colleagues Nancy Pelosi said: "President Trump had a temper tantrum for us all to see." This is not true. I was purposely very polite and calm much as I was minutes later with the press in the Rose Garden. Can be easily proven. It is all such a lie!
We had FAR more people (many millions) watching us at the RNC than did Sleepy Joe and the DNC and yet an ad just ran saying the opposite. This is what we’re up against. Lies. But we will WIN!
...Hopefully we will never have to use this power but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!
I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. They are wrong! Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing not a bad thing.......
Why are the Democrats allowed to make fake and fraudulent ads. They should be called out. They did nothing when they had the chance. I have done FAR more than any President in first 3 1/2 years!
I’m in the Oval Office. Democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes but with me in office I’ll get it built and Fast!
If Cuban Troops and Militia do not immediately CEASE military and other operations for the purpose of causing death and destruction to the Constitution of Venezuela a full and complete....
I am ready to send $105B to the states to help open schools safely with additional PPE. DEMOCRATS ARE HOLDING THIS UP!
Our record Economy would CRASH just like in 1929 if any of those clowns became President!
If that perfect phone call with the President of Ukraine Isn’t considered appropriate then no future President can EVER again speak to another foreign leader!
I have directed @stevenmnuchin1 to get ready to send direct payments ($3400 for family of four) to all Americans. DEMOCRATS ARE HOLDING THIS UP!
Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid Huma Abedin has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols. She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents. Remember sailors pictures on submarine? Jail! Deep State Justice Dept must finally act? Also on Comey & others
Former National Security Adviser for President Obama said "President Trump was absolutely correct" in taking out terroristist leader Soleimani. Thank you General Jones!
Unprecedented success for our Country in so many ways since the Election. Record Stock Market Strong on Military Crime Borders & ISIS Judicial Strength & Numbers Lowest Unemployment for Women & ALL Massive Tax Cuts end of Individual Mandate - and so much more. Big 2018!
Only high crimes and misdemeanors can lead to impeachment. There were no crimes by me (No Collusion No Obstruction) so you can’t impeach. It was the Democrats that committed the crimes not your Republican President! Tables are finally turning on the Witch Hunt!
The Wacky Do Nothing Attorney General of Michigan Dana Nessel is viciously threatening Ford Motor Company for the fact that I inspected a Ventilator plant without a mask. Not their fault & I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan until I came along!
Think of it. I became President of the United States in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation. From long before I ever took office I was under a sick & unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the Russian....
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:00 P.M. Thank you!
Great work by my Administration over the holidays to save Coast Guard pay during this #SchumerShutdown. No thanks to the Democrats who left town and are not concerned about the safety and security of Americans!
Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets. Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office!
Spokesman speaks stupidly on behalf of China trying desperately to deflect the pain and carnage that their country spread throughout the world. Its disinformation and propaganda attack on the United States and Europe is a disgrace....
The Democrats now own the shutdown!
Today’s Stock Market is the highest in the history of our great Country! This is the 104th time since the Election of 2016 that we have reached a NEW HIGH. Congratulations USA!
Just signed Bill. Our Military will now be stronger than ever before. We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more. First time this has happened in a long time. Also means JOBS JOBS JOBS!
The Rigged Witch Hunt originally headed by FBI lover boy Peter S (for one year) & now 13 Angry Democrats should look into the missing DNC Server Crooked Hillary’s illegally deleted Emails the Pakistani Fraudster Uranium One Podesta & so much more. It’s a Democrat Con Job!
I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election. Unlike others they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U.S.) and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business!
Happy Memorial Day! Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today. Best economy in decades lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER (& women in 18years) rebuilding our Military and so much more. Nice!
The Democrat House would not give us lawyers or not one witness but now demand that the Republican Senate produce the witnesses that the House never sought or even asked for? They had their chance but pretended to rush. Most unfair & corrupt hearing in Congressional history!
We have turned away at great expense two major Caravans but a big one has now formed and is coming. At least 8000 people! If we had a powerful Wall they wouldn’t even try to make the long and dangerous journey. Build the Wall and Crime will Fall!
Many incredible things are happening right now for our Country. After years of being ripped off by other nations on both Trade Deals and the Military things are changing fast. Big progress is being made. America is respected again. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
Where’s the Whistleblower?
Like every American I deserve to meet my accuser especially when this accuser the so-called "Whistleblower" represented a perfect conversation with a foreign leader in a totally inaccurate and fraudulent way. Then Schiff made up what I actually said by lying to Congress......
WITCH HUNT!
Mitch McConnell just told a group of people and me that he has been in the U.S. Senate for 32 years and the last two have been by far the best & most productive of his career. Tax & Regulation Cuts VA Choice Farm Bill Criminal Justice Reform Judgeships & much more. Great!
The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is now asking for "fairness" when he and the Democrat House members worked together to make sure I got ZERO fairness in the House. So what else is new?
The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our "very stupid" trade deals and policies. Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years. They laugh at what fools our leaders have been. No more!
Some people HATE the fact that I got along well with President Putin of Russia. They would rather go to war than see this. It’s called Trump Derangement Syndrome!
Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe but he never took notes when he was with me. I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda probably at a later date. Same with lying James Comey. Can we call them Fake Memos?
Do not believe the Fake News Media. Oklahoma speech had the highest Saturday television ratings in @FoxNews history. @seanhannity dominated T.V. with my interview on Thursday night more than @CNN & MSDNC COMBINED. These are the real polls the Silent Majority not FAKE POLLS!
Today we honor the brave Native American/First Nations soldiers who served our Nation and played a vital role in America's victory in WWII. The Navajo Code was never broken and saved untold American lives. Our country will be forever grateful. Happy Navajo Code Talkers Day!
Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. I just got back and it is a far worse situation than almost anyone would understand an invasion! I have been there numerous times - The Democrats Cryin’ Chuck and Nancy don’t know how bad and dangerous it is for our ENTIRE COUNTRY....
The Dems are getting another beauty to join their group. Bill de Blasio of NYC considered the worst mayor in the U.S. will supposedly be making an announcement for president today. He is a JOKE but if you like high taxes & crime he’s your man. NYC HATES HIM!
Our testing is so much bigger and more advanced than any other country (we have done a great job on this!) that it shows more cases. Without testing or weak testing we would be showing almost no cases. Testing is a double edged sword - Makes us look bad but good to have!!!
Really sick to watch the Fake and totally Slanted News(?) coming out of MSDNC and CNN. It bears NO relationship to the Truth or Facts. They are merely offshoots of the DNC much like the @nytimes and the Amazon @washingtonpost. Just like 2016 but worse. Sad but we will win big!
Law Enforcement has been strongly notified to watch closely for any ILLEGAL VOTING which may take place in Tuesday’s Election (or Early Voting). Anyone caught will be subject to the Maximum Criminal Penalties allowed by law. Thank you!
Susan Rice who was a disaster to President Obama as National Security Advisor is now telling us her opinion on what to do in Syria. Remember RED LINE IN THE SAND? That was Obama. Millions killed! No thanks Susan you were a disaster.
I often said during rallies with little variation that "Mexico will pay for the Wall." We have just signed a great new Trade Deal with Mexico. It is Billions of Dollars a year better than the very bad NAFTA deal which it replaces. The difference pays for Wall many times over!
The FAKE & FRAUDULENT NEWS MEDIA is working hard to convince Republicans and others I should not use social media - but remember I won....
Mexico’s Soldiers recently pulled guns on our National Guard Soldiers probably as a diversionary tactic for drug smugglers on the Border. Better not happen again! We are now sending ARMED SOLDIERS to the Border. Mexico is not doing nearly enough in apprehending & returning!
...Your housing prices will go up based on the market and crime will go down. I have rescinded the Obama-Biden AFFH Rule. Enjoy!
...children in question were very sick before they were given over to Border Patrol. The father of the young girl said it was not their fault he hadn’t given her water in days. Border Patrol needs the Wall and it will all end. They are working so hard & getting so little credit!
California leads the nation by far in both the number of homeless people and the percentage increase in the homeless population - two terrible stats. Crazy Nancy should focus on that in her very down district and helping her incompetent governor with the big homeless problem!
CNN is working frantically to find their "source." Look hard because it doesn’t exist. Whatever was left of CNN’s credibility is now gone!
This is my 500th. Day in Office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any President in his first 500 days. Massive Tax & Regulation Cuts Military & Vets Lower Crime & Illegal Immigration Stronger Borders Judgeships Best Economy & Jobs EVER and much more...
I was actually sticking up for Sleepy Joe Biden while on foreign soil. Kim Jong Un called him a "low IQ idiot" and many other things whereas I related the quote of Chairman Kim as a much softer "low IQ individual." Who could possibly be upset with that?
Big wins against ISIS!
I love Michigan one of the reasons we are doing such a GREAT job for them during this horrible Pandemic. Yet your Governor Gretchen "Half" Whitmer is way in over her head she doesn’t have a clue. Likes blaming everyone for her own ineptitude! #MAGA
Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: "Trump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again...Schumer and Dems caved...gambled and lost." Thank you for your honesty Jim!
Rep. Adam Schiff totally made up my conversation with Ukraine President and read it to Congress and Millions. He must resign and be investigated. He has been doing this for two years. He is a sick man!
A massive 200 Billion Dollar Sea Wall built around New York to protect it from rare storms is a costly foolish & environmentally unfriendly idea that when needed probably won’t work anyway. It will also look terrible. Sorry you’ll just have to get your mops & buckets ready!
Did anyone get to see that absolute "Joke" of a Town Hall interview that Joe Biden did with Concast @NBCNews  hosted by Lester Holt? What a disgrace to our Country that FREE public airwaves can be used that way. All SOFTBALLS. A big FIX. Time should be paid by the corrupt DNC!
Bolton’s book which is getting terrible reviews is a compilation of lies and made up stories all intended to make me look bad. Many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made pure fiction. Just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is!
My experience yesterday in Poland was a great one. Thank you to everyone including the haters for the great reviews of the speech!
The public is learning (even more so) how dishonest the Fake News is. They totally misrepresent what I say about hate bigotry etc. Shame!
"Nadler calls ANTIFA violence a MYTH." @foxandfriends  They are Anarchists with miles of "tape" showing their illegal activity. Jerry blame it on Russia Russia Russia!
The United States made some of the worst Trade Deals in world history.Why should we continue these deals with countries that do not help us?
Psycho Joe Scarborough is rattled not only by his bad ratings but all of the things and facts that are coming out on the internet about opening a Cold Case. He knows what is happening!
Looking like a big win for Boris in the U.K.!
Made additional remarks on Charlottesville and realize once again that the #Fake News Media will never be satisfied...truly bad people!
The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can’t win based on all of the achievements of "Trump" so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security - and Presidential Harassment. For them strictly politics!
The Democrats do not want us to detain or send back criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy!
Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection. This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election. I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first!
Some states use "drop boxes" for the collection of Universal Mail-In Ballots. So who is going to "collect" the Ballots and what might be done to them prior to tabulation? A Rigged Election? So bad for our Country. Only Absentee Ballots acceptable!
On 245  occasions former FBI Director James Comey told House investigators he didn’t know didn’t recall or couldn’t remember things when asked. Opened investigations on 4 Americans (not 2) - didn’t know who signed off and didn’t know Christopher Steele. All lies!
I will be addressing the Nation this evening at 9:00 P.M. (Eastern) from the Oval Office.
Another new Stock Market Record. Enjoy!
Kimberly Klacik is really working hard to help the people of Baltimore. She is running for Congress as a Republican & if she wins she will be an inspiration to all. She is strong on inner city rebuilding healthcare our Military & Vets. She has my Complete & Total Endorsement!
Michigan sends absentee ballot applications to 7.7 million people ahead of Primaries and the General Election. This was done illegally and without authorization by a rogue Secretary of State. I will ask to hold up funding to Michigan if they want to go down this Voter Fraud path!
Late last night our deadline we reached a wonderful new Trade Deal with Canada to be added into the deal already reached with Mexico. The new name will be The United States Mexico Canada Agreement or USMCA. It is a great deal for all three countries solves the many......
If Nancy Pelosi thinks that Walls are "immoral" why isn’t she requesting that we take down all of the existing Walls between the U.S. and Mexico even the new ones just built in San Diego at their very strong urging. Let millions of unchecked "strangers" just flow into the U.S.
Mayor Gillum conceded on Election Day and now Broward County has put him "back into play." Bill Nelson conceded Election - now he’s back in play!? This is an embarrassment to our Country and to Democracy!
I will be holding a News Conference at 3:30 P.M. at the White House. Thank you!
"NO PRESSURE"
Our Economy is the envy of the World!
Put big game trophy decision on hold until such time as I review all conservation facts. Under study for years. Will update soon with Secretary Zinke. Thank you!
Mexico is paying for the Wall through the new USMCA Trade Deal. Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work. $5.6 Billion Dollars that House has approved is very little in comparison to the benefits of National Security. Quick payback!
For those who want and advocate for illegal immigration just take a good look at what has happened to Europe over the last 5 years. A total mess! They only wish they had that decision to make over again.
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
China just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them. They have just suspended U.S. Tariff Hikes. U.S. is doing very well. China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. It could happen and rather soon!
The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope. Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!
...It will soon be time to choose to keep and build upon that prosperity and success or let it go. We are respected again all around the world. Keep it that way! I said I will never let you down and I haven’t. We will only grow bigger better and stronger TOGETHER!
White House news conference today at 5:45 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate. Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage. Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment!
Really bad news! The Baltimore house of Elijah Cummings was robbed. Too bad!
From Bush 1 to present our Country has lost more than 55000 factories 6000000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad Policies & Leadership. Must WIN again!  #MAGA
We don’t want what is happening with immigration in Europe to happen with us!
NASDAQ HAD ITS 23RD RECORD CLOSE OF THE YEAR. OTHER EXCHANGES ARE FOLLOWING CLOSELY BEHIND. TREMENDOUS POTENTIAL REMAINING. BIG MONTHS UPCOMING. NEXT YEAR DEPENDING ON AN ELECTION WIN WILL BE ONE OF THE BEST EVER! @LouDobbs
The Fake News and phony Fake Suppression Polls have never been worse. The Lamestream Media has gone CRAZY!
It now seems the General Flynn was under investigation long before was common knowledge. It would have been impossible for me to know this but if that was the case and with me being one of two people who would become president why was I not told so that I could make a change?
ISIS uses the internet better than almost anyone but for all of those susceptible to ISIS propaganda they are now being beaten badly at every level....
This isn’t about the Wall everybody knows that a Wall will work perfectly (In Israel the Wall works 99.9%). This is only about the Dems not letting Donald Trump & the Republicans have a win. They may have the 10 Senate votes but we have the issue Border Security. 2020!
Wow! -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch. Warner did not want a "paper trail" on a "private" meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame. All tied into Crooked Hillary.
Mail-In Ballot fraud found in many elections. People are just now seeing how bad dishonest and slow it is. Election results could be delayed for months. No more big election night answers? 1% not even counted in 2016. Ridiculous! Just a formula for RIGGING an Election....
What the Democrats have done in trying to steal a Presidential Election first at the "ballot box" and then after that failed with the "Insurance Policy" is the biggest Scandal in the history of our Country!
"WE’RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT." Can you believe this is the Governor of the Highest Taxed State in the U.S. Andrew Cuomo having a total meltdown!
As I said today and many times before "I have GREAT confidence in MY intelligence people." However I also recognize that in order to build a brighter future we cannot exclusively focus on the past – as the world’s two largest nuclear powers we must get along! #HELSINKI2018
I am pleased to announce that Congressman Mark Meadows will become White House Chief of Staff. I have long known and worked with Mark and the relationship is a very good one....
BLM Protesters horribly harass elderly Pittsburgh diners scaring them with loud taunts while taking their food right off their plate. These Anarchists not protesters are Biden voters but he has no control and nothing to say. Disgraceful. Never seen anything like it. Thugs!
I don’t care that most of the workers not getting paid are Democrats I want to stop the Shutdown as soon as we are in agreement on Strong Border Security! I am in the White House ready to go where are the Dems?
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!
Churches in Texas should be entitled to reimbursement from FEMA Relief Funds for helping victims of Hurricane Harvey (just like others).
The United States must at long last be treated fairly on Trade. If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods and they charge us 25 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated. That is not Free or Fair Trade it is Stupid Trade!
We made most Governors look very good even great by getting them the Ventilators unlimited Testing and supplies all of which they should have had in their own stockpiles. So they look great and I just keep rolling along doing great things and getting Fake Lamestream News!
On my way Nevada!
ISIS is on the run & will soon be wiped out of Syria & Iraq illegal border crossings are way down (75%) & MS 13 gangs are being removed.
Pray for the people in the Bahamas. Being hit like never before Category 5.  Almost 200 MPH winds.
Please understand there are consequences when people cross our Border illegally whether they have children or not - and many are just using children for their own sinister purposes. Congress must act on fixing the DUMBEST & WORST immigration laws anywhere in the world! Vote "R"
Deepest condolences to the families & fellow officers of the VA State Police who died today. You're all among the best this nation produces.
If the Democrats don’t give us the votes to change our weak ineffective and dangerous Immigration Laws we must fight hard for these votes in the 2020 Election!
NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION TOTAL EXONERATION. DEMOCRAT WITCH HUNT!
George Conway often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him is VERY jealous of his wife’s success & angry that I with her help didn’t give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!
I am in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security. From what I hear they are spending so much time on Presidential Harassment that they have little time left for things like stopping crime and our military!
Cuomo ridiculously wanted "40 thousand Ventilators". We gave him a small fraction of that number and it was plenty. State should have had them in stockpile!
A year ago the pundits & talking heads people that couldn’t do the job before were begging for conciliation and peace - "please meet don’t go to war." Now that we meet and have a great relationship with Kim Jong Un the same haters shout out "you shouldn’t meet do not meet!"
For FAR TOO LONG Senate Democrats have been Obstructing more than 350 Nominations. These great Americans left their jobs to serve our Country but can’t because Dems are blocking them some for two years-historic record. Passed committees but Schumer putting them on hold. Bad!
Things are going really well for our economy a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing! Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA. Really good news and much more to come!
Our military is being mobilized at the Southern Border. Many more troops coming. We will NOT let these Caravans which are also made up of some very bad thugs and gang members into the U.S. Our Border is sacred must come in legally. TURN AROUND!
Great earnings coming out of Stock Market. Too bad Media doesn’t devote much time to this!
STOCK MARKET CLOSES AT ALL-TIME HIGH! What a great time for the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats to Impeach your favorite President especially since he has not done anything wrong!
I just cannot state strongly enough how totally dishonest much of the Media is. Truth doesn’t matter to them they only have their hatred & agenda. This includes fake books which come out about me all the time always anonymous sources and are pure fiction. Enemy of the People!
The Woodward book is a scam. I don’t talk the way I am quoted. If I did I would not have been elected President. These quotes were made up. The author uses every trick in the book to demean and belittle. I wish the people could see the real facts - and our country is doing GREAT!
GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO! Just spoke to Mary Barra CEO of General Motors who informed me that subject to a UAW agreement etc. GM will be selling their beautiful Lordstown Plant to Workhorse where they plan to build Electric Trucks. GM will also be spending $700000000 in Ohio...
Mexico is doing very little if not NOTHING at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border and then into the U.S. They laugh at our dumb immigration laws. They must stop the big drug and people flows or I will stop their cash cow NAFTA. NEED WALL!
I never said Russia did not meddle in the election I said "it may be Russia or China or another country or group or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer." The Russian "hoax" was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did!
If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign that is a really big deal. Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers. Drain the Swamp!
....Great bravery shown by police. California Highway Patrol was on scene within 3 minutes with first officer to enter shot numerous times. That Sheriff’s Sergeant died in the hospital. God bless all of the victims and families of the victims. Thank you to Law Enforcement.
Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an "A"-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements. Working hard!
Hope the Fake News which never discusses it is talking about the big crowds forming for my New Hampshire Rally tonight. They won’t!
Can you imagine what the outcry would be if @SnoopDogg failing career and all had aimed and fired the gun at President Obama? Jail time!
Getting ready to meet the LSU Tigers the National Champions. Great Coach great Team great School. Very exciting!
"Republican voter registration is way up Democrat numbers are down." @foxandfriends
Despite so many false statements and lies total and complete vindication...and WOW Comey is a leaker!
Wow nobody realized how far Mini Mike Bloomberg went in bribing ex-prisoners to go out and vote for Sleepy Joe. He is desperate to get back into the good graces of the people who not only badly beat him but made him look like a total fool. Now he’s committed a serious crime!
The Lamestream Media refuses to talk about our Country’s record setting Jobs Numbers which are indicating GREATNESS and soon!
Highest Stock Market EVER best economic numbers in years unemployment lowest in 17 years wages raising border secure S.C.: No WH chaos!
We are a great Sovereign Nation. We have Strong Borders and will never accept people coming into our Country illegally!
As most people know and for those who would like to know I am strongly Pro-Life with the three exceptions - Rape Incest and protecting the Life of the mother - the same position taken by Ronald Reagan. We have come very far in the last two years with 105 wonderful new.....
The @nytimes story is a Fake just like the "paper" itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later and Peter Navarro memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News!
Good for the consumer gasoline prices coming down!
Mexico is doing NOTHING to help stop the flow of illegal immigrants to our Country. They are all talk and no action. Likewise Honduras Guatemala and El Salvador have taken our money for years and do Nothing. The Dems don’t care such BAD laws. May close the Southern Border!
PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that "US Tariffs were kind of insulting" and he "will not be pushed around." Very dishonest & weak. Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy!
Getting great reviews finally for how well we are handling the pandemic especially our strong production of desperately needed ventilators the building of field hospitals & beds and soon the great things we are doing on testing. People are really working well together!
The Fake News is not mentioning the safety and security of our Country when talking about illegal immigration. Our immigration laws are the weakest and worst anywhere in the world and the Dems will do anything not to change them & to obstruct-want open borders which means crime!
Twitter is getting rid of fake accounts at a record pace. Will that include the Failing New York Times and propaganda machine for Amazon the Washington Post who constantly quote anonymous sources that in my opinion don’t exist - They will both be out of business in 7 years!
READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!
Talks with China are going very well!
Honored to finally put an end to the "Widow’s Tax" and ensure that our surviving military spouses receive their full benefits. The spouses and families of our fallen heroes have suffered enough and WE must do everything in our power to ease the burden.
"President Trump is a ratings hit. Since reviving the daily White House briefing Mr. Trump and his coronavirus updates have attracted an average audience of 8.5 million on cable news roughly the viewership of the season finale of ‘The Bachelor.’ Numbers are continuing to rise...
When you are the "Piggy Bank" Nation that foreign countries have been robbing and deceiving for years the word TARIFF is a beautiful word indeed! Others must treat the United States fairly and with respect - We are no longer the "fools" of the past!
The U.S. Coast Guard FEMA and all Federal and State brave people are ready. Here comes Irma. God bless everyone!
Mini Mike Bloomberg has instructed his third rate news organization not to investigate him or any Democrat but to go after President Trump only. The Failing New York Times thinks that is O.K. because their hatred & bias is so great they can’t even see straight. It’s not O.K.!
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!
We are on track to APPREHEND more than one million people coming across the Southern Border this year. Great job by Border Patrol (and others) who are working in a Broken System. Can be fixed by Congress so easily and quickly if only the Democrats would get on board!
Joe Hiden’ gets off his airplane grabs and shakes a rather stunned man’s hand (like in the old days) then touches his (Joe’s) face and mask with the same hand. No crowd no enthusiasm for Joe today. Law & Order!
At the request of Congressman Moolenaar I have approved a major Disaster Declaration to provide more than $43 million in Federal Funds to help the people of the GREAT State of Michigan recover from the recent dam break flooding. I will always stand with Michigan!
There is no reason for these massive deadly and costly forest fires in California except that forest management is so poor. Billions of dollars are given each year with so many lives lost all because of gross mismanagement of the forests. Remedy now or no more Fed payments!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
Looking forward to being with the Bush family. This is not a funeral this is a day of celebration for a great man who has led a long and distinguished life. He will be missed!
Remember this every Governor who has sky high approval on their handling of the Coronavirus and I am happy for them all could in no way have gotten those numbers or had that success without me and the Federal Governments help. From Ventilators to Testing we made it happen!
It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened! Witch Hunt!
...The problem is no matter what the Radical Left Democrats get no matter what we give them it will never be enough. Just watch they will Harass & Complain & Resist (the theme of their movement). So maybe we should just take our victory and say NO we’ve got a Country to run!
Because of how badly they did with the Impeachment Hoax AOC will primary Cryin’ Chuck Schumer and win and Jerry Nadler has a good chance of losing to his far left primary opponent! It is all getting quite interesting. Pelosi will lose the House AGAIN! My poll numbers great.
The Democrats want to abolish ICE which will mean more crime in our country. I want to give ICE a big cheer! Vote Republican in November.
It is a wonderful feeling to know that our States are loaded up with Ventilators many brand new and high quality just off of our production lines and that we are now in a position to help other countries that so desperately need them. Every person needing a Ventilator got one!
It’s incredible how Democrats can all use their ridiculous sound bite and say that a Wall doesn’t work. It does and properly built almost 100%! They say it’s old technology - but so is the wheel. They now say it is immoral- but it is far more immoral for people to be dying!
"We absolutely need a physical barrier or Wall whatever you want to call it. The President yesterday laid all that out. We need to do it all including the Wall. I provided the same information to the previous administration & it was ignored." Mark Morgan Border Chief for "O"!
Corrupt Joe Biden has confirmed that he "would give UNLIMITED Healthcare to Illegal Immigrants". This would break our system and bring millions of people to the USA. @foxandfriends
....something that is so obviously the future. I want the United States to win through competition not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies. We must always be the leader in everything we do especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology!
My friend Herman Cain a truly wonderful man has asked me not to nominate him for a seat on the Federal Reserve Board. I will respect his wishes. Herman is a great American who truly loves our Country!
Informed Dr. Fauci this morning that he has nothing to do with NFL Football. Forced Democrat run Minnesota to bring in the National Guard & end rioting & looting after seeing the destruction & crime in Minneapolis. 100% successful! Waiting to hear from Dem run Washington State...
Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that with proper Forest Management would never happen. Unless they get their act together which is unlikely I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!
WITCH HUNT! There was no Russian Collusion. Oh I see there was no Russian Collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no Russian Collusion. The phony Russian Collusion was a made up Hoax. Too bad they didn’t look at Crooked Hillary like this. Double Standard!
It is finally sinking through. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS even worse! Lost cred.
MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands but these killers come back in from El Salvador and through Mexico like water. El Salvador just takes our money and Mexico must help MORE with this problem. We need The Wall!
California’s sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk. Thousands of dangerous & violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies set free to prey on innocent Americans. THIS MUST STOP!
The Mueller investigation is totally conflicted illegal and rigged! Should never have been allowed to begin except for the Collusion and many crimes committed by the Democrats. Witch Hunt!
Just arrived in the Great State of Ohio. Real Polls have us leading by even more than 2016. With Biden being against Fracking (Energy & Jobs) & your Second Amendment we should be in very good shape!
Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this. Russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?
Wow! If Elizabeth Warren wasn’t in the race Bernie Sanders would have EASILY won Massachusetts Minnesota and Texas not to mention various other states. Our modern day Pocahontas won’t go down in history as a winner but she may very well go down as the all time great SPOILER!
PASTOR BRUNSON JUST RELEASED. WILL BE HOME SOON!
Just had a great conversation with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I told him that the just completed Olympic venue is magnificent. He has done an incredible job one that will make him very proud. Good things will happen for Japan and their great Prime Minister. Lots of options!
The Trump Campaign has more ENTHUSIASM according to many than any campaign in the history of our great Country - Even more than 2016. Biden has NONE! The Silent Majority will speak on NOVEMBER THIRD!!! Fake Suppression Polls & Fake News will not save the Radical Left.
Congratulations America we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History...and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction. The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!
China just agreed that the U.S. will be allowed to sell beef and other major products into China once again. This is REAL news!
Schools in our country should be opened ASAP. Much very good information now available. @SteveHiltonx @FoxNews
The United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers workers and companies. While sending their product into our country tax free. We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades — and that is long enough.
Wow just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons opened up an investigation on me for no reason & with no proof after I fired Lyin’ James Comey a total sleaze!
The Dems have tried every trick in the playbook-call me everything under the sun. But if I’m all of those terrible things how come I beat them so badly 306-223? Maybe they’re just not very good! The fact is they are going CRAZY only because they know they can’t beat me in 2020!
Stock Market hits RECORD HIGH. Spend your money well!
.....Censorship is a very dangerous thing & absolutely impossible to police. If you are weeding out Fake News there is nothing so Fake as CNN & MSNBC & yet I do not ask that their sick behavior be removed. I get used to it and watch with a grain of salt or don’t watch at all..
The long anticipated release of the #JFKFiles will take place tomorrow. So interesting!
I am allowing Japan & South Korea to buy a substantially increased amount of highly sophisticated military equipment from the United States.
If this were a prizefight they’d stop it!
We are getting great marks for the handling of the CoronaVirus pandemic especially the very early BAN of people from China the infectious source entering the USA. Compare that to the Obama/Sleepy Joe disaster known as H1N1 Swine Flu. Poor marks bad polls - didn’t have a clue!
Thank you to our GREAT Republican Members of Congress for your VOTE to fund Border Security and the Wall. The final numbers were 217-185 and many have said that the enthusiasm was greater than they have ever seen before. So proud of you all. Now on to the Senate!
I have long given the order to help Argentina with the Search and Rescue mission of their missing submarine. 45 people aboard and not much time left. May God be with them and the people of Argentina!
WHERE’S HUNTER?
"Police Groups Break With Biden" @politico His handlers want him to "Defund the Police." I want more money for Law Enforcement!
Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for "peanuts" only to build a new one in an off location for 1.2 billion dollars. Bad deal. Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO!
The Radical Left Democrats have gone absolutely crazy that I am doing daily Presidential News Conferences. They actually want me to STOP! They used to complain that I am not doing enough of them now they complain that I "shouldn’t be allowed to do them." They tried to shame.....
Tiger Woods showed great class in the way he answered the question about the Office of the Presidency and me. Now they say the so-called "left" is angry at him. So sad but the "center & right" loves Tiger Kanye George Foreman Jim Brown & so many other greats even more.......
....History shows that a school shooting lasts on average 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained gun adept teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!
....is NOT their fault in any way shape or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!
Wow! Despite the Democrats views across TV and online lie (Con!) we had 147.9 million the Republican National Convention blew the Democrat National Convention  AWAY. Not even close! Just like their lies on Russia Football (PLAY!) and everything else! NOVEMBER 3rd.
4.2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut & Jobs Bill....and it will only get better! We are far ahead of schedule.
Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place. They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary. Now that will not happen!
The only problem our economy has is the Fed. They don’t have a feel for the Market they don’t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders. The Fed is like a powerful golfer who can’t score because he has no touch - he can’t putt!
Best January for the DOW in over 30 years. We have by far the strongest economy in the world!
Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at but my non-dealings are?
The Fake News hates me saying that they are the Enemy of the People only because they know it’s TRUE. I am providing a great service by explaining this to the American People. They purposely cause great division & distrust. They can also cause War! They are very dangerous & sick!
I will be doing a news conference on the ChinaVirus the just announced very good economic numbers and the improving economy at 7pm from Bedminster New Jersey. Also the subject of the Beirut Lebanon catastrophe will be discussed.
Tremendous surge in new housing construction in December 16.9% biggest in many years!
Chris Wallace "forgot" to ask a very weak and pathetic Schumer puppet Senator Chrisie Coons why Biden fought me when I put an extremely early BAN on people coming into our Country from heavily infected China. Biden later admitted I was right! But why no question?
Congressman Adam Schiff should resign for the Crime of after reading a transcript of my conversation with the President of Ukraine (it was perfect) fraudulently fabricating a statement of the President of the United States and reading it to Congress as though mine! He is sick!
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer is complaining for publicity purposes only that I should be asking for more money than $2.5 Billion to prepare for Coronavirus. If I asked for more he would say it is too much. He didn’t like my early travel closings. I was right. He is incompetent!
Very disappointed with General Motors and their CEO Mary Barra for closing plants in Ohio Michigan and Maryland. Nothing being closed in Mexico & China. The U.S. saved General Motors and this is the THANKS we get! We are now looking at cutting all @GM subsidies including....
Wonderful Church service at Camp David. Thank you!
Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1.7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress the FBI or Justice called for an investigation!
These riots are an antigovernment movement from the Left that are all in Democrat run cities. The mayors have got to let their police do what they know how to do. Would be very easy to suppress or call in the Federal Government. We will solve problem fast! @foxandfriends
Democrats fix the laws. Don’t RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama but we need strength and security at the Border! Cannot accept all of the people trying to break into our Country. Strong Borders No Crime!
Remember Republicans the Democrats already had 17 witnesses we were given NONE! Witnesses are up to the House not up to the Senate. Don’t let the Dems play you!
Wow CNN had to retract big story on "Russia" with 3 employees forced to resign. What about all the other phony stories they do? FAKE NEWS!
Happy Labor Day! Our country is doing better than ever before with unemployment setting record lows. The U.S. has tremendous upside potential as we go about fixing some of the worst Trade Deals ever made by any country in the world. Big progress being made!
John Kerry had illegal meetings with the very hostile Iranian Regime which can only serve to undercut our great work to the detriment of the American people. He told them to wait out the Trump Administration! Was he registered under the Foreign Agents Registration Act? BAD!
Despite all of the great success that our Country has had over the last 3 years it makes it much more difficult to deal with foreign leaders (and others) when I am having to constantly defend myself against the Do Nothing Democrats & their bogus Impeachment Scam. Bad for USA!
Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats turned down my offer yesterday before I even got up to speak. They don’t see crime & drugs they only see 2020 - which they are not going to win. Best economy! They should do the right thing for the Country & allow people to go back to work.
Employment is up Taxes are DOWN. Enjoy!
....a man who is considered by many to be the President with the most successful first two years in history especially when he has done nothing wrong and impeachment is for "high crimes and misdemeanors"?
"The Washington Post ignored basic journalistic standards because it wanted to advance its well-known and easily documented biased agenda against President Donald J. Trump." Covington student suing WAPO. Go get them Nick. Fake News!
Jesse Watters "The only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House."  So true!
The economy of the United States is stronger than ever before!
Heading to Davos Switzerland to meet with World and Business Leaders and bring Good Policy and additional Hundreds of Billions of Dollars back to the United States of America! We are now NUMBER ONE in the Universe by FAR!!
The Democrats just aren’t calling about DACA. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast or they’ll disappoint you again. We have a great chance to make a deal or blame the Dems! March 5th is coming up fast.
Leakin’ James Comey must have set a record for who lied the most to Congress in one day. His Friday testimony was so untruthful! This whole deal is a Rigged Fraud headed up by dishonest people who would do anything so that I could not become President. They are now exposed!
Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly NEED THE WALL. Must also end loophole of "catch & release" and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border NOW for Safety & Security reasons.
Congratulations to Bob Kraft Bill Belichick Tom Brady and the entire New England Patriots team on a great game and season. Will be a fantastic Super Bowl!
This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present. #DemocratShutdown
Just watched Mike Wallace wannabe Chris Wallace on @FoxNews. I am now convinced that he is even worse than Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Press(please!) or the people over at Deface the Nation. What the hell is happening to @FoxNews. It’s a whole new ballgame over there!
....Our Immigration policy laughed at all over the world is very unfair to all of those people who have gone through the system legally and are waiting on line for years! Immigration must be based on merit - we need people who will help to Make America Great Again!
I think that Crooked Hillary Clinton should enter the race to try and steal it away from Uber Left Elizabeth Warren. Only one condition. The Crooked one must explain all of her high crimes and misdemeanors including how & why she deleted 33000 Emails AFTER getting "C" Subpoena!
Biden/Obama were a disaster in handling the H1N1 Swine Flu. Polling at the time showed disastrous approval numbers. 17000 people died unnecessarily and through incompetence! Also don’t forget their 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website that should have cost close to nothing!
Our Border Patrol people are not hospital workers doctors or nurses. The Democrats bad Immigration Laws which could be easily fixed are the problem. Great job by Border Patrol above and beyond. Many of these illegals aliens are living far better now than where they.....
In 2016 I almost won Minnesota. In 2020 because of America hating anti-Semite Rep. Omar & the fact that Minnesota is having its best economic year ever I will win the State! "We are going to be a nightmare to the President" she say. No AOC Plus 3 are a Nightmare for America!
Will the Democrats apologize after seeing what was said on the call with the Ukrainian President? They should a perfect call - got them by surprise!
We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall there is no Deal!
If Russia or some other entity was hacking why did the White House wait so long to act? Why did they only complain after Hillary lost?
More people are working today in the United States 158000000 than at any time in our Country’s history. That is a Big Deal!
.....are therefore given massive advantages over The United States and everyone else? Prior to the Plague floating in from China our Economy was blowing everybody away the best of any country EVER. We will be there again and soon!
"Donald Trump’s Approval Rating is at or near his highest level ever. The media is not being honest about what is happening in this Country." Jesse Watters
A low level staffer that I hardly knew named Cliff Sims wrote yet another boring book based on made up stories and fiction. He pretended to be an insider when in fact he was nothing more than a gofer. He signed a non-disclosure agreement. He is a mess!
Economic numbers looking REALLY good. Can you imagine if I had long term ZERO interest rates to play with like the past administration rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today. That would have been SO EASY! Still markets up BIG since 2016 Election!
....even to new heights of success and glory but not with King Elijah and that crew. When the leaders of Baltimore want to see the City rise again I am in a very beautiful oval shaped office waiting for your call!
So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn’t want to go there. Same negative stories over and over again! No wonder the People no longer trust the media whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!    #MAGA
The end result of the greatest Witch Hunt in U.S. political history is No Collusion with Russia (and No Obstruction). Pretty Amazing!
NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION. Besides how can you have Obstruction when not only was there No Collusion (by Trump) but the bad actions were done by the "other" side? The greatest con-job in the history of American Politics!
...at every turn in attempts to gain access. But now Republicans and Democrats must come together for the good of the American people. No more costly & time consuming investigations. Lets do Immigration (Border) Infrastructure much lower drug prices & much more - and do it now!
The California Fire Fighters FEMA and  First Responders are amazing and very brave. Thank you and God Bless you all!
#AMERICA FIRST!
Do nothing A.G. of the Great State of Michigan Dana Nessel should not be taking her anger and stupidity out on Ford Motor - they might get upset with you and leave the state like so many other companies have - until I came along and brought business back to Michigan. JOBS!
There is NO WAY a place like Pennsylvania can vote for the Radical Left and their puppet Joe Biden when they are against fracking steel production and just about everything else that Pennsylvania stands for. Likewise Texas and many other states!!!
I have been very critical about the way the U.K. and Prime Minister Theresa May handled Brexit. What a mess she and her representatives have created. I told her how it should be done but she decided to go another way. I do not know the Ambassador but he is not liked or well....
Had a beautiful dinner last night at Camp David in celebration of the 10th Wedding Anniversary of Ivanka and Jared. Attended by a small number of family and friends it could not have been nicer. Camp David is a special place. Cost of the event will be totally paid for by me!
This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!
Dow just broke 25000. Tremendous news!
So-called comedian Michelle Wolf bombed so badly last year at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner that this year for the first time in decades they will have an author instead of a comedian. Good first step in comeback of a dying evening and tradition! Maybe I will go?
Veterans on President Trump’s handling of Border Security - 62% Approval Rating. On being a strong leader - 59%.  AP Poll. Thank you!
Fake News Equals the Enemy of the People!
"We have greater confidence in our call for a V-shaped recovery given recent upside surprises in growth data and policy action." Chetan Ahya Chief Economist at Morgan Stanley
I have asked China to immediately remove all Tariffs on our agricultural products (including beef pork etc.) based on the fact that we are moving along nicely with Trade discussions....
Congratulations to Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher his wonderful wife Andrea and his entire family. You have been through much together. Glad I could help!
Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration. Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky!
Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time. March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA. Make a deal!
If we can help little #CharlieGard as per our friends in the U.K. and the Pope we would be delighted to do so.
Dow goes from 18589 on November 9 2016 to 25075 today for a new all-time Record. Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks Record fastest 1000 point move in history. This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda! Jobs Jobs Jobs. Six trillion dollars in value created!
Mitch get back to work and put Repeal & Replace Tax Reform & Cuts and a great Infrastructure Bill on my desk for signing. You can do it!
Senate Republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent they are voting on desperately needed Border Security & the Wall. Our Country is being invaded with Drugs Human Traffickers & Criminals of all shapes and sizes. That’s what this vote is all about. STAY UNITED!
Crazy Bernie takes the lead in the Democrat Primaries but it is looking more and more like the Dems will never allow him to win! Will Sleepy Joe be able to stumble across the finish line?
What do I know about branding maybe nothing (but I did become President!) but if I were Boeing I would FIX the Boeing 737 MAX add some additional great features & REBRAND the plane with a new name.No product has suffered like this one. But again what the hell do I know?
....The flags at the White House will be lowered today through Thursday August 8. Melania and I are praying for all those impacted by this unspeakable act of evil!
Representative Ilhan Omar is again under fire for her terrible comments concerning Israel. Jewish groups have just sent a petition to Speaker Pelosi asking her to remove Omar from Foreign Relations Committee. A dark day for Israel!
Well run States should not be bailing out poorly run States using CoronaVirus as the excuse! The elimination of Sanctuary Cities Payroll Taxes and perhaps Capital Gains Taxes must be put on the table. Also lawsuit indemnification & business deductions for restaurants & ent.
Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration. Because they didn’t want to and now they just talk!
Mike Pompeo Director of the CIA will become our new Secretary of State. He will do a fantastic job! Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service! Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA and the first woman so chosen. Congratulations to all!
Joe Biden is coming out of the basement earlier than his hoped for ten days because his people told him he has no choice his poll numbers are PLUNGING! Going to Pittsburgh where I have helped industry to a record last year & then back to his  basement for an extended period...
This is now the 7th. time the FBI has investigated Judge Kavanaugh. If we made it 100 it would still not be good enough for the Obstructionist Democrats.
....Will be getting almost $23 BILLION for Border Security. Regardless of Wall money it is being built as we speak!
A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!!
We will not be touching your Social Security or Medicare in Fiscal 2021 Budget. Only the Democrats will destroy them by destroying our Country’s greatest ever Economy!
The incompetent Mayor of Washington D.C. @MayorBowser who’s budget is totally out of control and is constantly coming back to us for "handouts" is now fighting with the National Guard who saved her from great embarrassment...
Before Nancy who has lost all control of Congress and is getting nothing done decides to defend her leader Rep. Omar she should look at the anti-Semitic anti-Israel and ungrateful U.S. HATE statements Omar has made. She is out of control except for her control of Nancy!
White House news conference today at 5:30 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
Now AP estimates that the real Cuomo number of people killed because of his total incompetence is 11000 not the 6000 that was originally thought!
.....trial in the Senate and so that our Country can get back to business. We will have Schiff the Bidens Pelosi and many more testify and will reveal for the first time how corrupt our system really is. I was elected to "Clean the Swamp" and that’s what I am doing!
Thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas is a complete and total Fraud!
Gave an OFF THE RECORD luncheon somewhat of a White House tradition or custom to network anchors yesterday - and they quickly leaked the contents of the meeting. Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media which has gone totally bonkers!
More Testing which is a good thing (we have the most in the world) equals more Cases which is Fake News Gold. They use Cases to demean the incredible job being done by the great men & women of the U.S. fighting the China Plague!
....just the large States - the Cities would end up running the Country. Smaller States & the entire Midwest would end up losing all power - & we can’t let that happen. I used to like the idea of the Popular Vote but now realize the Electoral College is far better for the U.S.A.
The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border risking thousands of lives in the process. It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans. We must build a Great Wall think Merit and end Lottery & Chain. USA!
After years of Comey with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more) running the FBI its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not we will bring it back to greatness.
"Federal Judge throws out Stormy Danials lawsuit versus Trump. Trump is entitled to full legal fees." @FoxNews Great now I can go after Horseface and her 3rd rate lawyer in the Great State of Texas. She will confirm the letter she signed! She knows nothing about me a total con!
Breaking News: The President of Ukraine has just again announced that President Trump has done nothing wrong with respect to Ukraine and our interactions or calls. If the Radical Left Democrats were sane which they are not it would be case over!
I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats including the Bidens. In fact he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this it was only to sell a book. With that being said the...
...It cannot overcome the dedication of our doctors nurses and scientists — and it cannot beat the LOVE PATRIOTISM and DETERMINATION of our citizens. Strong and United WE WILL PREVAIL!
DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military.
I will be doing a major rally for Senator Ted Cruz in October. I’m picking the biggest stadium in Texas we can find. As you know Ted has my complete and total Endorsement. His opponent is a disaster for Texas - weak on Second Amendment Crime Borders Military and Vets!
Senator Mitch McConnell said I had "excessive expectations" but I don't think so. After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace why not done?
A great day at the White House!
According to NBC News Voters Nationwide Disapprove of the so-called Mueller Investigation (46%) more than they Approve (41%). You mean they are finally beginning to understand what a disgusting Witch Hunt led by 17 Angry Democrats is all about!
The United States will impose large sanctions on Turkey for their long time detainment of Pastor Andrew Brunson a great Christian family man and wonderful human being. He is suffering greatly. This innocent man of faith should be released immediately!
I have just authorized a doubling of Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum with respect to Turkey as their currency the Turkish Lira slides rapidly downward against our very strong Dollar! Aluminum will now be 20% and Steel 50%. Our relations with Turkey are not good at this time!
We have become a far greater Economic Power than ever before and we are using that power for WORLD PEACE!
Feels good to be home after seven months but the White House is very special there is no place like it... and the U.S. is really my home!
We must always arrest people coming into our Country illegally. Of the 12000 children 10000 are being sent by their parents on a very dangerous trip and only 2000 are with their parents many of whom have tried to enter our Country illegally on numerous occasions.
You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history - led by some very bad and conflicted people!  #MAGA
Big T was not a reference to me but rather to Big Tech which should have been properly pointed out in Twitter’s Fake Trending Section!
....I am a Tariff Man. When people or countries come in to raid the great wealth of our Nation I want them to pay for the privilege of doing so. It will always be the best way to max out our economic power. We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN
....There is a lot of explaining to do to the millions of people who had just elected a president who they really like and who has done a great job for them with the Military Vets Economy and so much more. This was the illegal and treasonous "insurance policy" in full action!
"New York Governor Cuomo says President Trump has been "very helpful." @foxandfriends  Thank you everybody is working very hard!
Senator Richard Burr The Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found NO COLLUSION BETWEEN TRUMP AND RUSSIA! Is anybody really surprised by this?
Polls are showing tremendous disapproval of Lamestream Media coverage of the Virus crisis. The Fake News just hasn’t figured that out yet!
Republican Senators have a very easy vote this week. It is about Border Security and the Wall (stopping Crime Drugs etc.) not Constitutionality and Precedent. It is an 80% positive issue. The Dems are 100% United as usual on a 20% issue Open Borders and Crime. Get tough R’s!
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:45 P.M. Thank you!
They are taking the Democrat Nomination away from Crazy Bernie just like last time. Some things never change!
Chuck Schumer sat for years during the Obama Administration and watched as China ripped off the United States. He & the Do Nothing Democrats did NOTHING as this $ carnage took place. Now without even seeing it he snipes at our GREAT new deal with China. Too bad Cryin’ Chuck!
I am the ultimate member of The Book of the Month Club. First I have lowlife dummy John Bolton a war mongering fool violating the law (he released massive amounts of Classified Information) and an NDA in order to build badly needed credibility and make a few dollars which
I am thinking about changing the name #FakeNews CNN to #FraudNewsCNN!
New Stock Market RECORD. Congratulations spend your money wisely. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!!!!!
Pocahontas (the bad version) sometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed. She took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be 1/1024 far less than the average American. Now Cherokee Nation denies her "DNA test is useless." Even they don’t want her. Phony!
Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country losses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security including a Wall is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months. Get it done!
We did a great job on CoronaVirus including the very early ban on China Ventilator production and Testing which is by far the most and best in the World. We saved millions of U.S. lives.! Yet the Fake News refuses to acknowledge this in a positive way. But they do give....
"Schiff blasted for not focusing on California homeless." @foxandfriends  His District is in terrible shape. He is a corrupt pol who only dreams of the Impeachment Hoax. In my opinion he is mentally deranged!
Fake News CNN is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony Russian stories. Ratings way down!
The Washington Post is a Fact Checker only for the Democrats. For the Republicans and for your all time favorite President it is a Fake Fact Checker!
The United States has been losing for many years 600 to 800 Billion Dollars a year on Trade. With China we lose 500 Billion Dollars. Sorry we’re not going to be doing that anymore!
The European Union is coming to Washington tomorrow to negotiate a deal on Trade. I have an idea for them. Both the U.S. and the E.U. drop all Tariffs Barriers and Subsidies! That would finally be called Free Market and Fair Trade! Hope they do it we are ready - but they won’t!
How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe the man in charge along with leakin’ James Comey of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation?
TREASON?
"A lot of people feel defeated...Trump always wins. It seems like nothing can stop him." Danny Villazon  @nytimes @DanaPerino @FoxNews  But isn’t that what you want from your President?
I will not be going to Florida because of the Shutdown - Staying in the White House!  #MAGA
NASDAQ has just gone above 8000 for the first time in history!
When the Failing @nytimes or Amazon @washingtonpost writes a story saying "unnamed sources said" or any such phrase where a person’s  name is not used don’t believe them. Most of these unnamed sources don’t exist. They are made up to defame & disparage. They have no "source"...
Secretary Pompeo and his "guests" will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 A.M. in the morning. I will be there to greet them. Very exciting!
News Conference at 9:30. Great Jobs Numbers!
Just like the NFL whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts. I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned I just find it hard to watch and always will until they stand for the FLAG!
Mexico is doing a far better job than the Democrats on the Border. Thank you Mexico!
I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy.
The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working. Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care. No thanks!
Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage and to have the right to stand on boxes or a lift during the debates. This is sometimes done but really not fair!
Nancy Pelosi’s District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come to the homeless & crime. It has gotten so bad so fast - she has lost total control and along with her equally incompetent governor Gavin Newsom it is a very sad sight!
All civilized nations must join together to protect human life and the sacred right of our citizens to live in safety and in peace.
Isn’t it ironic that large Caravans of people are marching to our border wanting U.S.A. asylum because they are fearful of being in their country - yet they are proudly waving....
....On Monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in International Waters. We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked how many will die. 150 people sir was the answer from a General. 10 minutes before the strike I stopped it not....
People are disgusted and embarrassed by the Fake News Media as headed by the @nytimes @washingtonpost @comcast & MSDNC @ABC @CBSNews and more. They no longer believe what they see and read and for good reason. Fake News is indeed THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
I have great confidence in King Salman and the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia they know exactly what they are doing....
The China Trade Deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the Agreement!
My son Donald did a good job last night. He was open transparent and innocent. This is the greatest Witch Hunt in political history. Sad!
Since my election as President the Dow Jones is up 43% and the NASDAQ Composite almost 50%. Great news for your 401(k)s as they continue to grow. We are bringing back America faster than anyone thought possible!
The U.S. economy is looking very good in my opinion even better than anticipated. Companies are pouring back into our country reversing the long term trend of leaving. The unemployment numbers are looking great and Regulations & Taxes have been massively Cut! JOBS JOBS JOBS
Any deaths of children or others at the Border are strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally. They can’t. If we had a Wall they wouldn’t even try! The two.....
The jury was not told the killer of Kate was a 7 time felon. The Schumer/Pelosi Democrats are so weak on Crime that they will pay a big price in the 2018 and 2020 Elections.
Does the so-called "Senior Administration Official" really exist or is it just the Failing New York Times with another phony source? If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist the Times must for National Security purposes turn him/her over to government at once!
Democrats are going to destroy your Social Security. I have totally left it alone as promised and will save it!
I can’t believe that Nancy Pelosi’s District in San Francisco is in such horrible shape that the City itself is in violation of many sanitary & environmental orders causing it to owe the Federal Government billions of dollars - and all she works on is Impeachment.....
The Fake News Media is giving @KamalaHarris a free pass despite her Radical Left failures and very poor run in the Democrat Primary. There was nobody meaner or more condescending to Slow Joe not even me and yet she quickly evaporated down to almost zero in the polls. Bad!
Sean Spicer is a wonderful person who took tremendous abuse from the Fake News Media - but his future is bright!
Trying to STEAL two big elections in Florida! We are watching closely!
My son @DonaldJTrumpJr is coming out with a new book "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us" – available tomorrow November 5th! A great new book that I highly recommend for ALL to read. Go order it today!
Looking more & more like the Trump Campaign for President was illegally being spied upon (surveillance) for the political gain of Crooked Hillary Clinton and the DNC. Ask her how that worked out - she did better with Crazy Bernie. Republicans must get tough now. An illegal Scam!
The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!
Sad to see the damage from the derecho in Midwest. 112 mile per hour winds in Midway Iowa! The Federal government is in close coordination with State officials. We are with you all the way - Stay safe and strong!
Uranium deal to Russia with Clinton help and Obama Administration knowledge is the biggest story that Fake Media doesn't want to follow!
Wow more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories. Hence my use of Social Media the only way to get the truth out. Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke! @foxandfriends
Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York wants to put New York at the END of the Vaccine List in that he doesn’t trust the @FDA or Federal Government even though the Vaccines are being developed by the finest Labs in the World. Wish he trusted us on Nursing Homes!
...history of Winning Victory and Freedom. The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds and won two World Wars. Therefore my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations...
Just out: MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS AT THE HIGHEST POINT EVER EVER EVER! How about saying it this way IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! Also MORE PEOPLE WORKING TODAY IN THE USA THAN AT ANY TIME IN HISTORY! Tough numbers for the Radical Left Democrats to beat! Impeach the Pres.
When I begrudgingly signed the Omnibus Bill I was promised the Wall and Border Security by leadership. Would be done by end of year (NOW). It didn’t happen! We foolishly fight for Border Security for other countries - but not for our beloved U.S.A. Not good!
On Trade France makes excellent wine but so does the U.S. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France and charges big Tariffs whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair must change!
Just returned to Washington from Louisiana & Texas after tours and discussions concerning Hurricane Laura. Thank you to @FEMA and ALL. God bless the families of those who perished!
Thanks to REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP America is WINNING AGAIN - and America is being RESPECTED again all over the world. Because we are finally putting AMERICA FIRST!
The Stock Market went up massively from the day after I won the Election all the way up to the day that I took office because of the enthusiasm for the fact that I was going to be President. That big Stock Market increase must be credited to me. If Hillary won - a Big Crash!
Wow! All of our priorities have made it into the final NDAA: Pay Raise for our Troops Rebuilding our Military Paid Parental Leave Border Security and Space Force! Congress – don’t delay this anymore! I will sign this historic defense legislation immediately!
Excited to see our friends in Egypt opening the biggest Cathedral in the Middle East. President El-Sisi is moving his country to a more inclusive future!
What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY not by 2025.
Got to see by accident wacko comedian Bill Maher’s show - So many lies. He said patients in El Paso hospital didn’t want to meet with me. Wrong! Had really great meetings with numerous patients. Said I was on vacation. Wrong! Long planned fix up of W.H. stay here rather than..
"Ax falls quickly at BuzzFeed and Huffpost!" Headline New York Post. Fake News and bad journalism have caused a big downturn. Sadly many others will follow. The people want the Truth!
The U.S. Embassy in Iraq is & has been for hours SAFE! Many of our great Warfighters together with the most lethal military equipment in the world was immediately rushed to the site. Thank you to the President & Prime Minister of Iraq for their rapid response upon request....
Wow! Big Trump Hater Congressman Joe Crowley who many expected was going to take Nancy Pelosi’s place just LOST his primary election. In other words he’s out! That is a big one that nobody saw happening. Perhaps he should have been nicer and more respectful to his President!
....John a loser and swear on whatever or whoever I was asked to swear on that I never called our great fallen soldiers anything other than HEROES. This is more made up Fake News given by disgusting & jealous failures in a disgraceful attempt to influence the 2020 Election!
Democrats can fix their forced family breakup at the Border by working with Republicans on new legislation for a change! This is why we need more Republicans elected in November. Democrats are good at only three things High Taxes High Crime and Obstruction. Sad!
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. There was no collusion everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion & yet on and on it goes. Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. Republicans should finally take control!
Congratulations to the Washington Capitals on their GREAT play and winning the Stanley Cup Championship. Alex Ovechkin the team captain was spectacular - a true Superstar! D.C. is popping in many ways. What a time!
AFTER TWO YEARS AND MILLIONS OF PAGES OF DOCUMENTS (and a cost of over $30000000) NO COLLUSION!
New FDA Rules make it more difficult for them to speed up vaccines for approval before Election Day. Just another political hit job! @SteveFDA
Heading to the Greatest Economy Of All Time!!!  VOTE
....vindication & exoneration from the Russian WikiLeaks and every other form of HOAX perpetrated by the DNC Radical Democrats and others. This is really big "stuff" especially coming from a highly respected judge who was appointed by President Clinton. The Witch Hunt Ends!
WOW @foxandfrlends  "Dossier is bogus. Clinton Campaign DNC funded Dossier. FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION. FBI TAINTED." And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign!
DACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryin’ Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration!
Dow hits 28000 - FIRST TIME EVER HIGHEST EVER! Gee Pelosi & Schitt have a good idea "lets Impeach the President." If something like that ever happened it would lead to the biggest FALL in Market History. It’s called a Depression not a Recession! So much for 401-K’s & Jobs!
Will be interviewed tonight by @seanhannity at 9:00. Enjoy!@FoxNews
Congratulations to Karen Handel on her big win in Georgia 6th. Fantastic job we are all very proud of you!
I want to thank Steve Bannon for his service. He came to the campaign during my run against Crooked Hillary Clinton - it was great! Thanks S
Good marks and reviews on the letter I sent to Pelosi today. She is the worst! No wonder with people like her and Cryin’ Chuck Schumer D.C. has been such a mess for so long - and that includes the previous administration who (and now we know for sure) SPIED on my campaign.
Wisconsin get out and vote NOW for Justice Daniel Kelly. Protect your 2nd Amendment!
One thing has now been proven. The Democrats do not care about Open Borders and all of the crime and drugs that Open Borders bring!
The farmers are really happy with the new China Trade Deal and the soon to be signed deal with Mexico and Canada but I hope the thing they will most remember is the fact that I was able to take massive incoming Tariff money and use it to help them get through the tough times!
....in January and February as the Virus spread globally? Why did the W.H.O. wait as long as it did to take decisive action? Lanhee Chen Hoover Institution Fellow @FoxNews
Pelosi and Schumer want Trillions of Dollars of BAILOUT money for Blue States that are doing badly both economically and in terms of high crime as a condition to making a deal on stimulus - But the USA is coming back strong!
.@Theresa_May don’t focus on me focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!
Everyone here is talking about why John Podesta refused to give the DNC server to the FBI and the CIA. Disgraceful!
I am pleased to announce that Kelly Knight Craft our current Ambassador to Canada is being nominated to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations....
Thanks to "Phantom Fireworks" and "Fireworks by Grucci" for their generosity in donating the biggest fireworks show Washington D.C. has ever seen. CEO's Bruce Zoldan and Phil Grucci are helping to make this the greatest 4th of July celebration in our Nations history!
NO COLLUSION - RIGGED WITCH HUNT!
....Hoax. My campaign was being seriously spied upon by intel agencies and the Democrats. This never happened before in American history and it all turned out to be a total scam a Witch Hunt that yielded No Collusion No Obstruction. This must never be allowed to happen again!
Democrats who want Open Borders and care little about Crime are incompetent but they have the Fake News Media almost totally on their side!
Sleepy Joe Biden had a very bad showing last night despite the fact that @GStephanopoulos didn’t ask him any questions on his being a "corrupt politician". Big Tech & Lamestream Media are working hard to hide this corruption!!!
Somebody please explain to Chris Wallace of Fox who will never be his father (and my friend) Mike Wallace that the Phone Conversation I had with the President of Ukraine was a congenial & good one. It was only Schiff’s made up version of that conversation that was bad!
Many are blaming me and the United States for the problems going on in Hong Kong. I can’t imagine why?
Is corrupt Bloomberg News going to say what a pathetic debater Mini Mike is that he doesn’t respect our great farmers or that he has violated campaign finance laws at the highest and most sinister level with "payoffs" all over the place?
The ONLY reason we were able to get our great USMCA Trade Deal approved was because the Do Nothing Democrats wanted to show that they could approve  something productive in light of the fact that all they even think about is impeachment. She knows nothing about the USMCA Deal!
Mitch use the Nuclear Option and get it done! Our Country is counting on you!
Mini Mike is a 5’4" mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians. No boxes please. He hates Crazy Bernie and will with enough money possibly stop him. Bernie’s people will go nuts!
Why is the United States Post Office which is losing many billions of dollars a year while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer? Should be charging MUCH MORE!
"Did George Bush ever condemn President Obama after Sandy Hook. President Obama had 32 mass shootings during his reign. Not many people said Obama is out of Control. Mass shootings were happening before the President even thought about running for Pres." @kilmeade @foxandfriends
We have narrowed the Presidential Nomination Acceptance Speech to be delivered on the final night of the Convention (Thursday) to two locations - The Great Battlefield of Gettysburg Pennsylvania and the White House Washington D.C. We will announce the decision soon!
It would show great weakness if Israel allowed Rep. Omar and Rep.Tlaib to visit. They hate Israel & all Jewish people & there is nothing that can be said or done to change their minds. Minnesota and Michigan will have a hard time putting them back in office. They are a disgrace!
Gregg Jarrett: "Mueller’s prosecutors knew the "Dossier" was the product of bias and deception." It was a Fake just like so much news coverage in our Country. Nothing but a Witch Hunt from beginning to end!
I will be having a 1:30 P.M. Press Conference at the White House to discuss the latest CoronaVirus developments. Thank you!
Very proud of my Executive Order which will allow greatly expanded access and far lower costs for HealthCare. Millions of people benefit!
The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over  exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible. With that being said leakers are traitors and cowards and we will find out who they are!
The only things the Democrats do well is "Resist" which is their campaign slogan and "Obstruct." Cryin’ Chuck Schumer has almost 400 great American people that are waiting "forever" to serve our Country! A total disgrace. Mitch M should not let them go home until all approved!
Almost everyone agrees that my Administration has done more in less than two years than any other Administration in the history of our Country. I’m tough as hell on people & if I weren’t nothing would get done. Also I question everybody & everything-which is why I got elected!
Everyone very excited about the new deal with Mexico!
The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal.  He was the one that created this MESS in the first place!
You will never hear this on the Fake News concerning the China Virus but by comparison to most other countries who are suffering greatly we are doing very well - and we have done things that few other countries could have done!
Will be going to Dayton Ohio and El Paso Texas tomorrow to meet with First Responders Law Enforcement and some of the victims of the terrible shootings.
.@FoxNews Polls are as in the past Fake News. They have been from the beginning way off in 2016. Get a new pollster. I believe we are leading BIG!
Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States. Lost almost $800 Billion/year under "O"
Mini Mike Bloomberg ads are purposely wrong - A vanity project for him to get into the game. Nobody in many years has done for the USA what I have done for the USA including the greatest economy in history rebuilding our military biggest ever tax & regulation cuts & 2nd A!
Thoughts and prayers to all of those affected by the shooting at the Synagogue in Poway California. God bless you all. Suspect apprehended. Law enforcement did outstanding job. Thank you!
Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do. The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011 and they decided not to do anything about DACA. They only want to use it as a campaign issue. Vote Republican!
Two dozen NFL players continue to kneel during the National Anthem showing total disrespect to our Flag & Country.  No leadership in NFL!
....The Radical Left always seems to have an Open Borders Open Arms policy – so this should make them very happy!
"Absolutely nothing" (on Russian Collusion). Kimberley Strassel The Wall Street Journal. The Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics. The only Russian Collusion was with Hillary and the Democrats!
.@FoxNews weekend afternoons is the worst! Getting into @CNN and MSDNC territory. Watch @OANN & @newsmax instead. Much better!
Dow just crashes through 25000. Congrats! Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing.
We will have Healthcare which is FAR BETTER than ObamaCare at a FAR LOWER COST - BIG PREMIUM REDUCTION. PEOPLE WITH PRE EXISTING CONDITIONS WILL BE PROTECTED AT AN EVEN HIGHER LEVEL THAN NOW. HIGHLY UNPOPULAR AND UNFAIR INDIVIDUAL MANDATE ALREADY TERMINATED. YOU’RE WELCOME!
So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives & billions of $$$. Why are we fighting for our enemy Syria by staying & killing ISIS for them Russia Iran & other locals? Time to focus on our Country & bring our youth back home where they belong!
Biggest & Fastest Financial Recovery In History. Next year will be BEST EVER unless a very Sleepy person becomes President and massively raises your taxes - In which case CRASH!
There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works and it stays!
Secretary of State Pompeo recieved permission from Ukraine Government to release the transcript of the telephone call I had with their President. They don’t know either what the big deal is. A total Witch Hunt Scam by the Democrats!
While not at all presidential I must point out that the Sloppy Michael Moore Show on Broadway was a TOTAL BOMB and was forced to close. Sad!
With Votes in the House tomorrow Democrats want to make it harder for Presidents to defend America and stand up to as an example Iran. Protect our GREAT COUNTRY!
For years Fake stories and investigations then the phony Russia Russia Russia HOAX next Ukraine and the failed Impeachment now the crummy Atlantic Magazine’s MADE UP STORY and lastly the political hit job by rapidly fading Bob Woodward and his boring book. It never ends!
Why are Republicans allowing the Democrats to have ridiculous Post Office hearings on Saturday & Monday just before and during our Convention. Let them hold them NOW (during their Convention) or after our Convention is over. Always playing right into their hands! @senatemajldr
My Administration is helping U.S. auto workers by replacing the failed Obama Emissions Rule. Impossible to satisfy its Green New Deal Standard; Lots of unnecessary and expensive penalties to car buyers!
...big Crooked Hillary law firm represented by her lawyer Michael Sussmann (do you believe this?) who worked Baker hard & gave him Oppo Research for "a Russia probe." This meeting now exposed is the subject of Senate inquiries and much more. An Unconstitutional Hoax. @FoxNews
Very disappointed in @SenSchumer for blocking the temporary extension of the $600 unemployment benefits. The Do Nothing Democrats are more interested in playing politics than in helping our deserving people. DRAIN THE SWAMP ON NOVEMBER 3RD!
....going to be there for three months and that was seven years ago - we never left. When I became President ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries including Turkey should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We’re coming home!
A big new Caravan is heading up to our Southern Border from Honduras. Tell Nancy and Chuck that a drone flying around will not stop them. Only a Wall will work. Only a Wall or Steel Barrier will keep our Country safe! Stop playing political games and end the Shutdown!
Yesterday was a big day for the stock market. Jobs are coming back to America. Chrysler is coming back to the USA from Mexico and many others will follow. Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing. American business is hot again!
We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER and we must have a great WALL to help protect us and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country!
Just revealed that the Failing and Desperate New York Times was feeding false stories about me & those associated with me to the FBI. This shows the kind of unprecedented hatred I have been putting up with for years with this Crooked newspaper. Is what they have done legal?...
Toyota & Mazda to build a new $1.6B plant here in the U.S.A. and create 4K new American jobs. A great investment in American manufacturing!
My deepest sympathies go out to Frieda Chera and the family of the late great Stanley Chera one of Manhattan’s most brilliant real estate minds. Stanley was charitable kind and a wonderful friend. He will be truly missed!
We have a massive Humanitarian Crisis at our Southern Border. We will be out for a long time unless the Democrats come back from their "vacations" and get back to work. I am in the White House ready to sign!
I keep reading Fake News stories that my campaign is running low on money. Not true & if it were so I would put up money myself. The fact is that we have much more money than we had 4 years ago where we spent much less money than Crooked Hillary and still easily won 306-223!
Baltimore’s numbers are the worst in the United States on Crime and the Economy. Billions of dollars have been pumped in over the years but to no avail. The money was stolen or wasted. Ask Elijah Cummings where it went. He should investigate himself with his Oversight Committee!
We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals. Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U.S. for many years. Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead. Sorry it’s time for a change! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew because of sources and methods (and more) would have to be heavily redacted whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency. Told them to re-do and send back in proper form!
Spoke to U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May today to offer condolences on the terrorist attack in London. She is strong and doing very well.
Because of the $700 & $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military many jobs are created and our Military is again rich. Building a great Border Wall with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M!
"No president in American history has been treated like this." @marklevinshow
I often stated "One way or the other Mexico is going to pay for the Wall." This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada) the USMCA is so much better than the old very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal that just by the money we save MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!
Not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border. Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts and what they are doing for our booming economy.
Remember when you hear the words "sources say" from the Fake Media often times those sources are made up and do not exist.
Wow I finally agree with failed political consultant Steve Schmidt who called Wacko John Bolton "a despicable man who failed in his duty to protect America." Also stated that he should never be allowed to serve in government again. So true! Plain and simple John Bolton....
The crowds at my Rallies are far bigger than they have ever been before including the 2016 election. Never an empty seat in these large venues many thousands of people watching screens outside. Enthusiasm & Spirit is through the roof. SOMETHING BIG IS HAPPENING - WATCH!
It is shameful that House Democrats won’t take a stronger stand against Anti-Semitism in their conference. Anti-Semitism has fueled atrocities throughout history and it’s inconceivable they will not act to condemn it!
Drain the Swamp should be changed to Drain the Sewer - it's actually much worse than anyone ever thought and it begins with the Fake News!
Women’s soccer player @mPinoe just stated that she is "not going to the F...ing White House if we win." Other than the NBA which now refuses to call owners owners (please explain that I just got Criminal Justice Reform passed Black unemployment is at the lowest level...
So hard to watch @FoxNews anymore. They are working so hard against the people (viewers) that got them there. Their contributors are a disaster and all over the place. The Radical Left has scared Fox into submission just like they have so many others. Sad but we will WIN!
Every day the brave men and women of ICE are liberating communities from savage gangs like MS-13. We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears in law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL!
The people of Germany are turning against their leadership as migration is rocking the already tenuous Berlin coalition. Crime in Germany is way up. Big mistake made all over Europe in allowing millions of people in who have so strongly and violently changed their culture!
You would think there is NO WAY that any of the Democrat Candidates that we witnessed last night could possibly become President of the United States. Now you see why they have no choice but to push a totally illegal & absurd Impeachment of one of the most successful Presidents!
If racist Elijah Cummings would focus more of his energy on helping the good people of his district and Baltimore itself perhaps progress could be made in fixing the mess that he has helped to create over many years of incompetent leadership. His radical "oversight" is a joke!
The Impeachment Scam is driving Republican Poll Numbers UP UP UP! Thank you Shifty.
Wow! The U.S. added 250000 Jobs in October - and this was despite the hurricanes. Unemployment at 3.7%. Wages UP! These are incredible numbers. Keep it going Vote Republican!
IF OUR FORMALLY TARGETED FARMERS NEED ADDITIONAL AID UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE TRADE DEALS WITH CHINA MEXICO CANADA AND OTHERS FULLY KICK IN THAT AID WILL BE PROVIDED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PAID FOR OUT OF THE MASSIVE TARIFF MONEY COMING INTO THE USA!
Biden FAILED BADLY with the Swine Flu. It was the Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight".  He didn’t have a clue. We have done an incredible job with the much tougher China Virus!
"The number of New Yorkers admitted to hospitals has dropped." @ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends  Good news!
If the Radical Left Democrats all of a sudden don’t want the Illegal Migrants in their Sanctuary Cities (no more open arms) why should others be expected to take them into their communities? Go home and come into our Country legally and through a system of Merit!
A big scandal at @ABC News. They got caught using really gruesome FAKE footage of the Turks bombing in Syria. A real disgrace. Tomorrow they will ask softball questions to Sleepy Joe Biden’s son Hunter like why did Ukraine & China pay you millions when you knew nothing? Payoff?
Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U.S. Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut and it will only get better. MUCH MORE TO COME!
The Economy is one of the best in our history with unemployment at a 50 year low and the Stock Market ready to again break a record (set by us many times) - & all you heard yesterday based on a phony story was Impeachment. You want to see a Stock Market Crash Impeach Trump!
I urge the Senate and House to pass the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act with additional funding for PPP Hospitals and Testing. After I sign this Bill we will begin discussions on the next Legislative Initiative with fiscal relief....
Rudy Giuliani did a GREAT job as Mayor of NYC during the period of September 11th. His leadership bravery and skill must never be forgotten. Rudy is a TRUE WARRIOR!
45000 construction & manufacturing jobs in the U.S. Gulf Coast region. $20 billion investment. We are already winning again America!
We have defeated ISIS in Syria my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.
So exciting! I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis Maryland. Looking forward to being there.
Great call with thousands of our Hispanic community business and faith leaders today. During this national trial we have been uplifted by the grit determination prayers and patriotism of Hispanic Americans....
I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!
Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the "Special" Counsel because the public understands that there was no  Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous) that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation & that the only Collusion was with the Dems!
.@WhiteHouse TRANSITION TO GREATNESS!
I will be doing a News Conference live from the @WhiteHouse at 5:00 P.M. (Eastern) to discuss the mtg of the G20 Leaders that took place this morning at 7:55 A.M. by World Teleconference. Also my 12:00 P.M. Teleconference call w/50 Governors plus Territories will be discussed.
I never said anything bad about Andrew McCabe’s wife other than she (they) should not have taken large amounts of campaign money from a Crooked Hillary source when Clinton was under investigation by the FBI. I never called his wife a loser to him (another McCabe made up lie)!
Corrupt Congressman Adam Schiff is angry that Ambassadors that he thought would be good for his fraudulent Witch Hunt are turning out to be good for me - some really good! He’s got all meetings locked down no transparency only his illegal leaks. A very dishonest sleazebag!
No Collusion and No Obstruction except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats. All of the resignations and corruption yet heavily conflicted Bob Mueller refuses to even look in that direction. What about the Brennan Comey McCabe Strzok lies to Congress or Crooked’s Emails!
The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging & demeaning my use of social media because they don't want America to hear the real story!
We must have Border Security get rid of Chain Lottery Catch & Release Sanctuary Cities - go to Merit based Immigration. Protect ICE and Law Enforcement and of course keep building but much faster THE WALL!
V.P. Mike Pence and team just left the White House. Briefed me on their meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives. Not much headway made today. Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!
When will Republican leadership learn that they are being played like a fiddle by the Democrats on Border Security and Building the Wall? Without Borders we don’t have a country. With Open Borders which the Democrats want we have nothing but crime! Finish the Wall!
I am proud to announce $2 million for the @Sept11Memorial in NYC! This special site ensures that the memory of the nearly 3000 people killed in the terror attacks of September 11 2001 as well as those lost in the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 will never be forgotten!
Read the Transcripts!
.@NYGovCuomo should get his puppet New York prosecutors who have been illegally after me and my family for years to investigate his incompetent handling of the China Virus and all of the deaths caused by this incompetence. It is at minimum a Nursing Home Scandal - 11000 DEAD!
Denmark is a very special country with incredible people but based on Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen’s comments that she would have no interest in discussing the purchase of Greenland I will be postponing our meeting scheduled in two weeks for another time....
"Former FBI Employee Accused of Altering FISA Documents." Hello here we go! @foxandfriends
....thought of within the U.S. We will no longer deal with him. The good news for the wonderful United Kingdom is that they will soon have a new Prime Minister. While I thoroughly enjoyed the magnificent State Visit last month it was the Queen who I was most impressed with!
Democrats in Congress must return from their Vacations and change the Immigration Laws or the Border despite the great job being done by Border Patrol will only get worse. Big sections of Wall now being built!
I guess the magazine "Christianity Today" is looking for Elizabeth Warren Bernie Sanders or those of the socialist/communist bent to guard their religion. How about Sleepy Joe? The fact is no President has ever done what I have done for Evangelicals or religion itself!
I think that China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election 2020 to see if they could get lucky & have a Democrat win - in which case they would continue to rip-off the USA for $500 Billion a year....
FAKE POLLING just like 2016 (but worse)!
Crooked Hillary Clinton now blames everybody but herself refuses to say she was a terrible candidate. Hits Facebook & even Dems & DNC.
"If they try to Impeach President Trump who has done nothing wrong (No Collusion) they will end up getting him re-elected" @LindseyGrahamSC Impeachment is for High Crimes and Misdemeanors. There were no High Crimes and Misdemeanors except for those committed by the other side!
Radical Left Governor @JayInslee and the Mayor of Seattle are being taunted and played at a level that our great Country has never seen before. Take back your city NOW. If you don’t do it I will. This is not a game. These ugly Anarchists must be stopped IMMEDIATELY. MOVE FAST!
Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!
Lets just call them WALLS from now on and stop playing political games! A WALL is a WALL!
I gave John Bolton who was incapable of being Senate confirmed because he was considered a wacko and was not liked a chance. I always like hearing differing points of view. He turned out to be grossly incompetent and a liar.   See judge’s opinion. CLASSIFIED INFORMATION!!!
The Senate should get funding done before the August break or NOT GO HOME. Wall and Border Security should be included. Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations worst in history. Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct all they know how to do. STAY!
Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54 was just $82. Thank you to Saudi Arabia but let’s go lower!
Opinion Editor at @nytimes just walked out. That’s right he quit over the excellent Op-Ed penned by our great Senator @TomCottonAR. TRANSPARENCY! The State of Arkansas is very proud of Tom. The New York Times is Fake News!!!
As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign. As many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI Justice & State. #DrainTheSwamp
CDC Director was totally misquoted by Fake News @CNN on Covid 19. He will be putting out a statement.
"If it weren’t for Donald Trump we would never know how corrupt these Democrats are we would never know for sure that there was a Deep State. Now we know it." @JudgeJeanine
Great work in the Republican Senate on some big nominees. Still 154 to go hope they don’t adjourn until the job is done! @senatemajldr
I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam where he lied about his service so he can at least say he was there
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR. Illegal immigration must end!
They never even saw the transcript of the call. A total Witch Hunt!
....The Dems and their committees are going "nuts." The Republicans never did this to President Obama there would be no time left to run government. I hear other committee heads will do the same thing. Even stealing people who work at White House! A continuation of Witch Hunt!
"The Trump Administration has succeeded in dramatically raising the costs to Iran for its sinister behavior at no cost to the U.S. or our allies. That’s the definition of a foreign-policy achievement." Bret Stephens @nytimes  We are getting stronger all over the world watch!
I was a big fan of Frank Robinson both as a great player and man. He was the first African American manager in baseball and was highly respected at everything he did. He will he missed!
Joe Biden got tongue tied over the weekend when he was unable to properly deliver a very simple line about his decision to run for President. Get used to it another low I.Q. individual!
I am pleased to announce that highly respected Congressman John Ratcliffe of Texas will be nominated by me to be the Director of National Intelligence. A former U.S. Attorney John will lead and inspire greatness for the Country he loves. Dan Coats the current Director will....
....cause big disruption by going to Manhattan. Working almost all of the time including evenings. Don’t have to be in W.H. to do that...And sooo many other false statements. He is right about one thing though. I will win again in 2020. Otherwise he pays 95% in taxes!
Very poor morning TV ratings for MSDNC’s Morning Joe headed by a complete Psycho named Joe Scarborough and his ditzy airhead wife Mika and also @CNN headed by complete unknowns. Congratulations to @foxandfriends on dominating the mornings (thank you President Trump!).
Congressman Adam Smith the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee just stated "Yes there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. It’s been done a number of times." No doubt but let’s get our deal done in Congress!
In addition to great incompetence and corruption The Smollett case in Chicago is also about a Hate Crime. Remember "MAGA COUNTRY DID IT!" That turned out to be a total lie had nothing to do with "MAGA COUNTRY." Serious stuff and not even an apology to millions of people!
I’m in the White House waiting. The Democrats are everywhere but Washington as people await their pay. They are having fun and not even talking!
....the possible exception of another Republican President the late great Abraham Lincoln...and it’s not even close. The Democrats know this and so does the Fake News but they refuse to write or say it because they are inherently corrupt! See "pinned" above.
Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan reversing a years long opposite trend. Thank you Chrysler a very wise decision. The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence. Plenty of more to follow!
The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out with such precision that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term "Mission Accomplished." I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term it should be brought back. Use often!
I have been watching people making phone calls my entire life. My hearing is and has been great. Never have I been watching a person making a call which was not on speakerphone and been able to hear or understand a conversation. I’ve even tried but to no avail. Try it live!
A Rigged System - They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress. What are they afraid of? Why so much redacting? Why such unequal "justice?" At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved!
All the Radical Left Democrats are trying to do with the Post Office hearings is blame the Republicans for the FRAUD that will occur because of the 51 Million Ballots that are being sent to people who have not even requested them. They are setting the table for a BIG MESS!
We lose 300 Americans a week 90% of which comes through the Southern Border. These numbers will be DRASTICALLY REDUCED if we have a Wall!
Drug prices declined in 2018 the first time in nearly half a century. During the first 19 months of my Administration Americans saved $26 Billion on prescription drugs. Our policies to get cheaper generic drugs to market are working!
There is a Revolution going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous crime infested & breeding concept. Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border but the people of the State are not happy. Want Security & Safety NOW!
Liz Cheney is only upset because I have been actively getting our great and beautiful Country out of the ridiculous and costly Endless Wars. I am also making our so-called allies pay tens of billions of dollars in delinquent military costs. They must at least treat us fairly!!!
Iran has just issued a New Warning. Rouhani says that they will Enrich Uranium to "any amount we want" if there is no new Nuclear Deal. Be careful with the threats Iran. They can come back to bite you like nobody has been bitten before!
I think what the Democrats are doing with the Border is TREASONOUS. Their Open Border mindset is putting our Country at risk. Will not let this happen!
Happy Columbus Day!
.@CBS and their show @60Minutes are doing everything within their power which is far less today than it was in the past to defend China and the horrible Virus pandemic that was inflicted on the USA and the rest of the World. I guess they want to do business in China!
Just out: The big deal very mysterious Don jr telephone calls after the innocent Trump Tower meeting that the media & Dems said were made to his father (me) were just conclusively found NOT to be made to me. They were made to friends & business associates of Don. Really sad!
Heading to New Jersey. Big Rally in fact Really Big Rally!
PLENTY OF OIL!
Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State. They go after Phony Collusion with Russia a made up Scam and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! What goes around comes around!
On International Women's Day join me in honoring the critical role of women here in America & around the world.
....Mueller was NOT fired and was respectfully allowed to finish his work on what I and many others say was an illegal investigation (there was no crime) headed by a Trump hater who was highly conflicted and a group of 18 VERY ANGRY Democrats. DRAIN THE SWAMP!
Jobless claims in the United States have reached their lowest (BEST) level in over 50 years!
Congress - FIX OUR INSANE IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW!
I am in South Korea now. President Moon and I have "toasted" our new Trade Deal a far better one for us than that which it replaced. Today I will visit with and speak to our Troops - and also go to the the DMZ (long planned). My meeting with President Moon went very well!
Today’s SCOTUS ruling is a historic win for families who want SCHOOL CHOICE NOW! #SchoolChoice is a civil rights issue and no parent should have to send their child to a failing school. I will continue to fight for School Choice and will always defend Religious Freedom!
....President. We are WINNING big the envy of the WORLD but just think what it could be?
"Biden to raise taxes by 3 Trillion Dollars." Actually it will be much more than that and much of it on nonsense. Markets and your 401k’s will CRASH. Jobs will disappear!
Just fired Agent Strzok formerly of the FBI was in charge of the Crooked Hillary Clinton sham investigation. It was a total fraud on the American public and should be properly redone!
Whatever happened to Hillary campaign manager Podesta’s BROTHER? Wasn’t he caught forced to leave his firm with BIG BAD things to happen? Why did nothing ever happen to him only to the "other" side?
"They say Roger Stone lied to Congress." @CNN  OH I see but so did Comey (and he also leaked classified information for which almost everyone other than Crooked Hillary Clinton goes to jail for a long time) and so did Andy McCabe who also lied to the FBI! FAIRNESS?
Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12000000?)....
The OPEC Monopoly must remember that gas prices are up & they are doing little to help. If anything they are driving prices higher as the United States defends many of their members for very little $’s. This must be a two way street. REDUCE PRICING NOW!
Will be leaving Florida for Washington (D.C.) today at 4:00 P.M. Much work to be done but it will be a great New Year!
Wow. The @nytimes is under siege. The real reason is that it has become Fake News. They never covered me correctly - they blew it. People are fleeing a total mess!
Hope all House Republicans and honest House Democrats will vote to CENSURE Rep. Adam Schiff tomorrow for his brazen and unlawful act of fabricating (making up) a totally phony conversation with the Ukraine President and U.S. President me. Most have never seen such a thing!
Armed congregants quickly stopped a crazed church shooter in Texas. If it were not for the fact that there were people inside of the church that were both armed and highly proficient in using their weapon the end result would have been catastrophic. A big THANK YOU to them!
I want to know where is the money for Border Security and the WALL in this ridiculous Spending Bill and where will it come from after the Midterms? Dems are obstructing Law Enforcement and Border Security. REPUBLICANS MUST FINALLY GET TOUGH!
"This was an illegal coup attempt on the President of the United States." Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends  True!
My thoughts condolences and prayers to the victims and families of the New York City terrorist attack. God and your country are with you!
Stock Market up big today. A New Record. Enjoy!
....care how many lives the ruin. These are Angry People including the highly conflicted Bob Mueller who worked for Obama for 8 years. They won’t even look at all of the bad acts and crimes on the other side. A TOTAL WITCH HUNT LIKE NO OTHER IN AMERICAN HISTORY!
White House News Conference at 5:45. Thank you!
My highly regarded Executive Order protected 525000 American jobs during the height of the Chinese Plague. Democrats want to have Open Borders!
Steel Dynamics announced that it will build a brand new 3 million ton steel mill in the Southwest that will create 600 good-paying U.S. JOBS. Steel JOBS are coming back to America just like I predicted. Congratulations to Steel Dynamics!
I am pleased to announce that David Bernhardt Acting Secretary of the Interior will be nominated as Secretary of the Interior. David has done a fantastic job from the day he arrived and we look forward to having his nomination officially confirmed!
....children from parents as did Bush etc. because that is the policy and law. I tried to keep them together but the problem is when you do that vast numbers of additional people storm the Border. So with Obama seperation is fine but with Trump it’s not. Fake 60 Minutes!
Volkswagen will be spending 800 million dollars in Chattanooga Tennessee. They will be making Electric Cars. Congratulations to Chattanooga and Tennessee on a job well done. A big win!
Social Media is totally discriminating against Republican/Conservative voices. Speaking loudly and clearly for the Trump Administration we won’t let that happen. They are closing down the opinions of many people on the RIGHT while at the same time doing nothing to others.......
"The Radical Left is trying hard to undermine the Christopher Columbus legacy. A great Italian opened new chapter in history of humanity by discovering the Americas".  @OANN  Not on my watch!
....and why hasn’t the Podesta brother been charged and arrested like others after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm? Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington D.C.?
The Fake News Media is going Crazy! They make up stories without any backup sources or proof. Many of the stories written about me and the good people surrounding me are total fiction. Problem is when you complain you just give them more publicity. But I’ll complain anyway!
Taliban targeted innocent Afghans brave police in Kabul today. Our thoughts and prayers go to the victims and first responders. We will not allow the Taliban to win!
DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the Iraq-Syria border yesterday. Their sacrifice in service to our country will never be forgotten.
So Crazy to watch Senator Blumenthal of Connecticut lecture all on morals & ethics when for 25 years he said he was a Great War Hero in Vietnam and he was never even there. He lied & cheated right up until the day he got caught. Thank you to those in military who turned him in!
House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed. Witch Hunt!
The Wall Street Journal asks "WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA?"  A very good question!
Brutal and Extended Cold Blast could shatter ALL RECORDS - Whatever happened to Global Warming?
It’s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA. Gave them 6 months they just don’t care. Where are they? We are ready to make a deal!
Happy to announce we are awarding $1M to Las Vegas - in order to help local law enforcement working OT to respond to last Sunday’s tragedy.
....embargo together with highest-level sanctions will be placed on the island of Cuba. Hopefully all Cuban soldiers will promptly and peacefully return to their island!
Crooked Hillary Clinton blames everybody (and every thing) but herself for her election loss. She lost the debates and lost her direction!
My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3500 while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Positive impact on the environment! Foolish executives!
I will help Angel Mom (and great woman) Mary Ann Mendoza with Twitter. I know Mary Ann from the beginning and she should never be silenced. She is a winner who has lost so much her child. Twitter if you’re watching please do what you have to do NOW!  @foxandfriends
I hope John Brennan the worst CIA Director in our country’s history brings a lawsuit. It will then be very easy to get all of his records texts emails and documents to show not only the poor job he did but how he was involved with the Mueller Rigged Witch Hunt. He won’t sue!
Never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all! In any event the United States under my Administration has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS. Where is our "Thank you America?"
The FAKE MSM is working so hard trying to get me not to use Social Media. They hate that I can get the honest and unfiltered message out.
Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded. Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled. Thank you and it will get even (much) better! @FoxNews
Totally clears the President. Thank you!
Thank you to Sean Parnell for the nice comments on @foxandfriends about the troops wonderful reaction to Melania and I in Iraq and Germany. Great things are happening!
I got NATO countries to pay 530 Billion Dollars a year more and the U.S. less and came home to a Fake News Media that mocked me. Didn’t think that was possible!
For years and through many administrations everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility. Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity. Look forward to our meeting!
We have a National Emergency at our Southern Border. The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico with the strongest immigration laws in the World refuses to help with illegal immigration & drugs!
A big deal looking good with Mexico!
Democrats are blocking a 251 Billion Dollar funding boost for Small Businesses which will help them keep their employees. It should be for only that reason with no additions. We should have a big Infrastructure Phase Four with Payroll Tax Cuts & more. Big Economic Bounceback!
I was never a big fan of John McCain disagreed with him on many things including ridiculous endless wars and the lack of success he had in dealing with the VA and our great Vets but the lowering of our Nations American Flags and the first class funeral he was given by our....
...the beauty that is being taken out of our cities towns and parks will be greatly missed and never able to be comparably replaced!
The booing at the NFL football game last night when the entire Dallas team dropped to its knees was loudest I have ever heard. Great anger
"John Brennan is panicking. He has disgraced himself he has disgraced the Country he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community. He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American’s faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the....
The Media (Fake News) is pushing Sleepy Joe hard. Funny I’m only here because of Biden & Obama. They didn’t do the job and now you have Trump who is getting it done - big time!
We are working hard at the Border but we need a WALL!  In 2018 1.7 million pounds of narcotics seized 17000 adults arrested with criminal records and 6000 gang members including MS-13 apprehended. A big Human Trafficking problem.
Great new book by @PastorDScott called "Nothing to Lose". The Pastor is a winner and a great guy. Much can be learned from him. Buy the book. Make him a Big Deal Author!
If the committee of Republicans and Democrats now meeting on Border Security is not discussing or contemplating a Wall or Physical Barrier they are Wasting their time!
Economy is BOOMING. Seems set to have yet another record day!
Universities will someday study what highly conflicted (and NOT Senate approved) Bob Mueller and his gang of Democrat thugs have done to destroy people. Why is he protecting Crooked Hillary Comey McCabe Lisa Page & her lover Peter S and all of his friends on the other side?
Could not have been treated more warmly in the United Kingdom by the Royal Family or the people. Our relationship has never been better and I see a very big Trade Deal down the road. "This trip has been an incredible success for the President." @IngrahamAngle
Landing in Wisconsin. Launching big new ship contract!
....Today’s action will help ensure that all Americans learn the truth about the events that occurred and the actions that were taken during the last Presidential election and will restore confidence in our public institutions." @PressSec
Rick Scott was up by 50000+ votes on Election Day now they "found" many votes and he is only up 15000 votes. "The Broward Effect." How come they never find Republican votes?
Biden got failing grades and polls on his clueless handling of the Swine Flu H1N1. It was a total disaster they had no idea what they were doing. Among the worst ever!
...to stop drugs they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do." My standard is very simple AMERICA FIRST & MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Last year was the best year for American Manufacturing job growth since 1997 or 21 years. The previous administration said manufacturing will not come back to the U.S. "you would need a magic wand." I guess I found the MAGIC WAND - and it is only getting better!
I’ve done more damage to ISIS than all recent presidents....not even close!
We cannot let those killed in El Paso Texas and Dayton Ohio die in vain. Likewise for those so seriously wounded. We can never forget them and those many who came before them. Republicans and Democrats must come together and get strong background checks perhaps marrying....
Judge Brett Kavanaugh is a fine man with an impeccable reputation who is under assault by radical left wing politicians who don’t want to know the answers they just want to destroy and delay. Facts don’t matter. I go through this with them every single day in D.C.
"Mainstream Media tries to rewrite history to credit Obama for Trump accomplishments. Since President Trump took office the economy is booming. The stronger the economy gets the more desperate his critics are. O had weakest recovery since Great Depression." @WashTimes
.....Sorry can’t let them into our Country. If too crowded tell them not to come to USA and tell the Dems to fix the Loopholes - Problem Solved!
How do you impeach a President who has created the greatest Economy in the history of our Country entirely rebuilt our Military into the most powerful it has ever been Cut Record Taxes & Regulations fixed the VA & gotten Choice for our Vets (after 45 years) & so much more?...
....Bolton broke the law and has been called out and rebuked for so doing with a really big price to pay. He likes dropping bombs on people and killing them. Now he will have bombs dropped on him!
Because of my strong focus on the China Virus including scheduled meetings on Vaccines our economy and much else I won’t be able to be in New York to throw out the opening pitch for the @Yankees on August 15th. We will make it later in the season!
Years ago when Media was legitimate people known as "Fact Checkers" would always call to check and see if a story was accurate. Nowadays they don’t use "Fact Checkers" anymore they just write whatever they want!
News Conference at 5:30 P.M. Enjoy!
The Mayor of Tijuana Mexico just stated that "the City is ill-prepared to handle this many migrants the backlog could last 6 months." Likewise the U.S. is ill-prepared for this invasion and will not stand for it. They are causing crime and big problems in Mexico. Go home!
Congress must get together and immediately eliminate the loopholes at the Border! If no action Border or large sections of Border will close. This is a National Emergency!
I am glad that my friend @EmmanuelMacron and the protestors in Paris have agreed with the conclusion I reached two years ago. The Paris Agreement is fatally flawed because it raises the price of energy for responsible countries while whitewashing some of the worst polluters....
Nothing funny about tired Saturday Night Live on Fake News NBC! Question is how do the Networks get away with these total Republican hit jobs without retribution? Likewise for many other shows? Very unfair and should be looked into. This is the real Collusion!
"School shooting survivor says he quit @CNN Town Hall after refusing scripted question." @TuckerCarlson. Just like so much of CNN Fake News. That’s why their ratings are so bad! MSNBC may be worse.
READ THE TRANSCRIPT!
I don’t know who Joaquin Castro is other than the lesser brother of a failed presidential candidate (1%) who makes a fool of himself every time he opens his mouth. Joaquin is not the man that his brother is but his brother according to most is not much. Keep fighting Joaquin!
The Democrats are allowing a ridiculous asylum system and major loopholes to remain as a mainstay of our immigration system. Mexico is likewise doing NOTHING a very bad combination for our Country. Homeland Security is being sooo very nice but not for long!
....to the people that got you there. Keep fighting for Tucker and fight hard for @JudgeJeanine. Your competitors are jealous - they all want what you’ve got - NUMBER ONE. Don’t hand it to them on a silver platter. They can’t beat you you can only beat yourselves!
A @FoxNews commentator just ripped me with lies with nobody defending. They talked about the "friendly" protesters (they set the Church on fire the day before. They were anything but friendly) and how I stood and held the Bible upside down - it wasn’t upside down. @edhenry
For all of the political hacks out there if I hadn’t done my job well & early we would have lost 1 1/2 to 2 Million People as opposed to the 100000 plus that looks like will be the number. That’s 15 to 20 times more than we will lose. I shut down entry from China very early!
Great to be in Singapore excitement in the air!
Soon to be Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week live from the Oval Office that the Republicans didn’t have the votes for Border Security. Today the House Republicans voted and won 217-185. Nancy does not have to apologize. All I want is GREAT BORDER SECURITY!
"How Trump Is Making Black America Great Again The Untold Story Of Black Advancement in the Era of Trump." By Horace Cooper  A great new book!
Melania our great and very hard working First Lady who truly loves what she is doing always thought that "if you run you will win." She would tell everyone that "no doubt he will win." I also felt I would win (or I would not have run) - and Country is doing great!
The building of the Wall on the Southern Border will bring down the crime rate throughout the entire Country!
Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8 but everyone will be trying....with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security. The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer!
We have a great economy DESPITE the Obama Administration and all of its job killing Regulations and Roadblocks. If that thinking prevailed in the 2016 Election the U.S. would be in a Depression right now! We were heading down and don’t let the Democrats sound bites fool you!
Just spoke to Mary Barra CEO of General Motors about the Lordstown Ohio plant. I am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our Country is BOOMING. I asked her to sell it or do something quickly. She blamed the UAW Union — I don’t care I just want it open!
Looks like Bernie Sanders is history. Sleepy Joe Biden is pulling ahead and think about it I’m only here because of Sleepy Joe and the man who took him off the 1% trash heap President O! China wants Sleepy Joe BADLY!
I will be going to Texas as soon as that trip can be made without causing disruption. The focus must be life and safety.
I am SUBSTANTIALLY LOWERING MEDICARE PREMIUMS. Have instituted Favored Nations Clause and Rebates on Drug Companies. Never been done before. Drug companies are hitting me with Fake Ads just like sleepy Joe. Be careful! Drug prices will be reduced massively and soon.
Despite the phony Witch Hunt going on in America the economic & jobs numbers are great. Regulations way down jobs and enthusiasm way up!
....Mexico must apprehend all illegals and not let them make the long march up to the United States or we will have no other choice than to Close the Border and/or institute Tariffs. Our Country is FULL!
"Years from now when we look back at this day nobody’s going to remember Nancy’s cheap theatrics they will remember though how President Trump brought the Chinese to the bargaining table and delivered achievements few ever thought were possible." @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews
Iran leadership doesn’t understand the words "nice" or "compassion" they never have. Sadly the thing they do understand is Strength and Power and the USA is by far the most powerful Military Force in the world with 1.5 Trillion Dollars invested over the last two years alone..
....Obamacare is a joke! Deductible is far too high and the overall cost is ridiculous. My Administration has gone out of its way to manage OC much better than previous but it is still no good. I will ALWAYS PROTECT PEOPLE WITH PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS ALWAYS ALWAYSALWAYS!!!
Sleepy Joe’s representatives have just put out an ad saying that I went to play golf (exercise) today. They think I should stay in the White House at all times. What they didn’t say is that it’s the first time I’ve played golf in almost 3 months that Biden was constantly.....
Pfizer & others should be ashamed that they have raised drug prices for no reason. They are merely taking advantage of the poor & others unable to defend themselves while at the same time giving bargain basement prices to other countries in Europe & elsewhere. We will respond!
"I live in New York. Even the most Liberal friends that I have are thinking twice about voting Democrat this time because they’ve seen what’s happened to the City under @NYCMayor de Blasio and the State under @NYGovCuomo - They’re getting eaten up by taxes." @DavidAsmanfox
Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G) then based his decisions on her poll numbers. Disgruntled he McCabe and the others committed many crimes!
Today I am making good on my promise to defend our Farmers & Ranchers from unjustified trade retaliation by foreign nations. I have authorized Secretary Perdue to implement the 2nd round of Market Facilitation Payments. Our economy is stronger than ever–we stand with our Farmers!
John Bolton one of the dumbest people I’ve met in government and sadly I’ve met plenty states often that I respected and even trusted Vladimir Putin of Russia more than those in our Intelligence Agencies. While of course that is not true if the first people you met from....
The failed Fast Train project in California where the cost overruns are becoming world record setting is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed Wall!
Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat. Debbie will do a Great Job! Press is so silent.
Oil prices are too high OPEC is at it again. Not good!
"Senate Intelligence Panel found absolutely no evidence of collusion. There was no evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government to influence 2016 affirming the findings of other investigations." Daily Caller
45 year low on illegal border crossings this year. Ice and Border Patrol Agents are doing a great job for our Country. MS-13 thugs being hit hard.
The Stock Market is up massively since the Election but is now taking a little pause - people want to see what happens with the Midterms. If you want your Stocks to go down I strongly suggest voting Democrat. They like the Venezuela financial model High Taxes & Open Borders!
The Mainstream Media has never been more inaccurate or corrupt than it is today. It only seems to get worse. So much Fake News!
22-O in my endorsements of Congressional Candidates this season. California & Wisconsin won big on Tuesday. Thank you to all of those very brilliant Voters. You will not be disappointed!
....The Wall will be paid for directly or indirectly or through longer term reimbursement by Mexico which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U.S. The $20 billion dollar Wall is "peanuts" compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S. NAFTA is a bad joke!
Thank you to the people of Colorado for the warm and gracious notes and letters sent to me for all of the Ventilators we got for you. It was my great honor! @SenCoryGardner
"President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy. Tax Cut bonuses to more than 2000000 workers. Most explosive Stock Market rally that we’ve seen in modern times. 18000 to 26000 from Election and grounded in profitability and growth. All Trump not 0...
Heading back from a very exciting two days in Davos Switzerland. Speech on America’s economic revival was well received. Many of the people I met will be investing in the U.S.A.! #MAGA
Thank you to highly respected Jewish leader Dov Hikind for his wonderful statements about me this morning on @foxandfriends.
After watching the disgraceful way that a wonderful man @BrettKavanaugh was treated by the Democrats and now seeing first hand how these same Radical Left Do Nothing Dems are treating the whole Impeachment Hoax I understand why so many Dems are voting Republican!
I am overriding the Decommission Order of the magnificent aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman built in 1998 (fairly new) and considered one of the largest and finest in the world. It will be updated at a fraction of the cost of a new one (which also are being built)!
Condolences to the family of the young woman killed today and best regards to all of those injured in Charlottesville Virginia. So sad!
So they caught Fake News CNN cold but what about NBC CBS & ABC? What about the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost? They are all Fake News!
John Kerry and Senator Chris Murphy grossly violated the Logan Act with respect to Iran. If a Republican did what they did there would be very serious ramifications!
.....The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
...I am doing what is necessary to keep our communities safe — and these people will be brought to Justice!
James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media. That is so illegal!
Tremendous backlash against the NFL and its players for disrespect of our Country.#StandForOurAnthem🇺🇸
ESPN is paying a really big price for its politics (and bad programming). People are dumping it in RECORD numbers. Apologize for untruth!
If the Wall Street Journal "Editorial" writers had called as they should have they would have easily found that I was "NOT happy with the Georgia Governor on Tuesday night." You said the opposite and got it wrong as you often do!
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue the White House is the place I have come to love and will stay for hopefully another 5 years as we MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN but my family and I will be making Palm Beach Florida our Permanent Residence. I cherish New York and the people of.....
The Mueller Angry Democrats recently deleted approximately 19000 Text messages between FBI Agent Lisa Page and her lover Agent Peter S. These Texts were asked for and INVALUABLE to the truth of the Witch Hunt Hoax. This is a total Obstruction of Justice. All Texts Demanded!
Iran’s Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reached...just another indicator that it was all a big lie. But not anymore!
Mark Penn  "Why are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Counsel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...Constitution was set up to prevent this...Stormtrooper tactics almost." A disgrace!
Getting VERY good reviews of the job the Federal Government is doing on CoronaVirus. Ventilators building hospitals beds and yes Testing have been handled incredibly well. Testing is getting exponentially better every day. Love seeing our Country safely opening up!
Democrats could solve the Shutdown in 15 minutes! Call your Dem Senator or Congresswoman/man. Tell them to get it done! Humanitarian Crisis.
Israel was very respectful & nice to Rep. Rashida Tlaib allowing her permission to visit her "grandmother." As soon as she was granted permission she grandstanded & loudly proclaimed she would not visit Israel. Could this possibly have been a setup? Israel acted appropriately!
I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm.
Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott. We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting.
Very simple! I was looking for Corruption and also why Germany France and others in the European Union don’t do more for Ukraine. Why is it always the USA that does so much and puts up so much money for Ukraine and other countries? By the way the Bidens were corrupt!
Joe Biden cannot LEAD our Country because he does not BELIEVE in our Country. At Biden’s convention they decried America as a wicked sinful nation destined for a fate of doom and despair. They even removed the words "Under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance – twice...
The Massive Tax Cuts which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves. Companies are already making big payments to workers. Dems want to raise taxes hate these big Cuts!
New Fox Poll shows a "40% Approval Rating by African Americans for President Trump a record for Republicans." Thank you a great honor!
....that we stand in solidarity with New Zealand – and that any assistance the U.S.A. can give we stand by ready to help. We love you New Zealand!
Mike Pompeo is doing a great job I am very proud of him. His predecessor Rex Tillerson didn’t have the mental capacity needed. He was dumb as a rock and I couldn’t get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell. Now it is a whole new ballgame great spirit at State!
The sleazy New York Democrats and their now disgraced (and run out of town) A.G. Eric Schneiderman are doing everything they can to sue me on a foundation that took in $18800000 and gave out to charity more money than it took in $19200000. I won’t settle this case!...
Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren who was going nowhere except into Mini Mike’s head just dropped out of the Democrat Primary...THREE DAYS TOO LATE. She cost Crazy Bernie at least Massachusetts Minnesota and Texas. Probably cost him the nomination! Came in third in Mass.
In New York State Democrats blocked a Bill expanding College Tuition for Gold Star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants. No wonder so many people are leaving N.Y. Very Sad!
Things will work out fine between the U.S.A. and Russia. At the right time everyone will come to their senses & there will be lasting peace!
So great that oil prices are falling (thank you President T). Add that which is like a big Tax Cut to our other good Economic news. Inflation down (are you listening Fed)!
Sleepy Joe Biden just said that he wished I closed up one week earlier — but when I banned China from coming in it took him TWO MONTHS to finally realize that was a good thing...
The Democrats have no message  not on economics not on taxes  not on jobs not on failing #Obamacare. They are only OBSTRUCTIONISTS!
If a deal is made with China our great American Farmers will be treated better than they have ever been treated before!
Weirdo Tom Steyer who didn’t have the "guts" or money to run for President is still trying to remain relevant by putting himself on ads begging for impeachment. He doesn’t mention the fact that mine is perhaps the most successful first 2 year presidency in history & NO C OR O!
Republicans should be strongly focused on completing a wonderful stimulus package for the American People!
For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!
So interesting to read and see all of the free and interesting advice I am getting on China from people who have tried to handle it before and failed miserably - In fact they got taken to the cleaners. We are doing very well with China. This has never happened to them before!
The Anti-Benghazi!
I am the only person in America who could say that "I’m bringing our great troops back home with victory" and get BAD press. It is Fake News and Pundits who have FAILED for years that are doing the complaining. If I stayed in Endless Wars forever they would still be unhappy!
....their country’s flag. Can this be possible? Yes because it is all a BIG CON and the American taxpayer is paying for it!
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.
I will be live from the White House at 4:00 P.M.
Internal REAL Polls show I am beating all of the Dem candidates. The Fake News Polls (here we go again just like 2016) show losing or tied. Their polls will be proven corrupt on November 3rd just like the Fake News is corrupt!
Many more people would have died from the China Virus if Sleepy Joe were your President. He didn’t even want me to close our Country to Infected China until TWO MONTHS  later when he said I was right. Now he likes to say I didn’t close up "fast enough". Just another politician!
Democrat Rep. Tlaib is being slammed for her horrible and highly insensitive statement on the Holocaust. She obviously has tremendous hatred of Israel and the Jewish people. Can you imagine what would happen if I ever said what she said and says?
If I hadn’t won the 2016 Election we would be in a Great Recession/Depression right now. The people I saw on stage last night & you can add in Sleepy Joe Harris & the rest will lead us into an economic sinkhole the likes of which we have never seen before. With me only up!
For our Country to be sending 80 million UNSOLICITED BALLOTS is very unfair and a roadmap to disaster. Even recent small and easier to control elections which did this are a catastrophic disaster. Fraudulent & missing Ballots like never seen before. 20% and 30% off. STOP!
Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration. The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years. They are hungry for food & for freedom. Along with human rights the wealth of Iran is being looted. TIME FOR CHANGE!
I will be doing a News Conference at 10:00 A.M. on the Jobs Numbers! White House.
So interesting to see Nancy Pelosi demanding fairness from @senatemajldr McConnell when she presided over the most unfair hearing in the history of the United States Congress!
"The best economy in our lifetime!" @IngrahamAngle
The Tax Cut/Reform Bill including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had. Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise...and our insider Polls are strong!
The Fake Washington Post keeps doing phony stories with zero sources that I am concerned with the Impeachment scam. I am not because I did nothing wrong. It is the other side including Schiff and his made up story that are concerned. Witch Hunt continues!
My Administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending their rights against California's illegal and unconstitutional Sanctuary policies. California's Sanctuary laws....
The Stock Market hit 25000 yesterday. Jobs are at an all time record - and that is before we fix some of the worst trade deals and conditions ever seen by any government. It is all happening!
Despite what you hear in the press healthcare is coming along great. We are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!
America is the Greatest Country in the world. We have the best scientists doctors nurses and health care professionals. They are amazing people who do phenomenal things every day....
After 200 days rarely has any Administration achieved what we have achieved..not even close! Don't believe the Fake News Suppression Polls!
The people of Venezuela are standing for FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY – and the United States of America is standing right by their side!
....long before they get to our Southern Border. Guatemala is getting ready to sign a Safe-Third Agreement. The only ones who won’t do anything are the Democrats in Congress. They must vote to get rid of the loopholes and fix asylum! If so Border Crisis will end quickly!
...today that they foiled a dangerous plot against the Governor of Michigan. Rather than say thank you she calls me a White Supremacist—while Biden and Democrats refuse to condemn Antifa Anarchists Looters and Mobs that burn down Democrat run cities...
Nancy Pelosi will go down as the least productive Speaker of the House in history. She is dominated by AOC Plus 3 and the Radical Left. Mexico and Canada after waiting for 6 months to be approved are ready to flee - and who can blame them? Too bad!
Just watched a world class loser Tim O’Brien who I haven’t seen or spoken to in many years & knows NOTHING about me except that he wrote a failed hit piece book about me 15 years ago. Fired like a dog from other jobs? Saw him on Lyin’ Brian Williams Trump Slam Show. Bad TV....
The rank and file of the FBI are great people who are disgusted with what they are learning about Lyin’ James Comey and the so-called "leaders" of the FBI. Twelve have been fired or forced to leave. They got caught spying on my campaign and then called it an investigation. Bad!
The Dems new weapon is actually their old weapon one which they never cease to use when they are down or run out of facts RACISM! They are truly disgusting! They even used it on Nancy Pelosi. I will be putting out a list of all people who have been so (ridiculously) accused!
I am pleased to announce the House has passed our budget deal 284-149. Great for our Military and our Vets. A big thank you!
Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud. They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally. System is rigged must go to Voter I.D.
Mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the Border. Problem is they’ve been "talking" for 25 years. We want action not talk. They could solve the Border Crisis in one day if they so desired. Otherwise our companies and jobs are coming back to the USA!
The only "Collusion" is that of the Democrats with Russia and many others. Why didn’t the FBI take the Server from the DNC? They still don’t have it. Check out how biased Facebook Google and Twitter are in favor of the Democrats. That’s the real Collusion!
The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall. Let work begin!
I see that John Kerry the father of the now terminated Iran deal is thinking of running for President. I should only be so lucky - although the field that is currently assembling looks really good - FOR ME!
"If Biden had any passion or respect for law enforcement he kept it well hidden in his Philadelphia address. He criticized cops far more than he did arsonists & looters." Michael Goodwin @nypost
Because Jobs in the U.S. are doing so well Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973. Great!
In NYC looks like another attack by a very sick and deranged person. Law enforcement is following this closely. NOT IN THE U.S.A.!
A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest!
Government Funding Bill past last night in the House of Representatives. Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders. Shutdown coming? We need more Republican victories in 2018!
The Fake News has never been more dishonest than it is today. Thank goodness we can fight back on Social Media. Their new weapon of choice is Fake Polling sometimes referred to as Suppression Polls (they suppress the numbers). Had it in 2016 but this is worse.....
Stock Market is heading for one of the best months (June) in the history of our Country. Thank you Mr. President!
Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL. What are they trying to hide?
In California Democrats have intentionally implemented rolling blackouts — forcing Americans in the dark. Democrats are unable to keep up with energy demand...
...What took place was completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated. Bill de Blasio should act immediately!
It is happening again to Crazy Bernie just like last time only far more obvious. They are taking the Democrat Nomination away from him and there’s very little he can do. A Rigged System!
Will Jerry Nadler ever look into the fact that Crooked Hillary deleted and acid washed 33000 emails AFTER getting a most powerful demand notice for them from Congress?
Sleepy Joe Biden has pledged to ABOLISH Suburban Communites as they currently exist by reinstating Obama’s radical AFFH Regulation. There goes Suburbia!
The Mueller Witch Hunt is a total disgrace. They are looking at supposedly stolen Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails (even though they don’t want to look at the DNC Server) but have no interest in the Emails that Hillary DELETED & acid washed AFTER getting a Congressional Subpoena!
"On February 19th there was a Democratic Debate in Las Vegas. Three words weren’t said: Virus CoronaVirus or COVID19. NEVER came up!" @BretBaier
I was on Air Force One flying to the Great State of Texas where I just landed. It is AMAZING in watching @FoxNews how different they are from four years ago. Not even watchable. They totally forgot who got them where they are!
I have no doubt that if the attack on Dr. Ford was as bad as she says charges would have been immediately filed with local Law Enforcement Authorities by either her or her loving parents. I ask that she bring those filings forward so that we can learn  date time and place!
For years even as a "civilian" I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare. Now they finally have their chance!
Representatives of the Post Office have repeatedly stated that they DO NOT NEED MONEY and will not make changes. This is all another HOAX by the Democrats to give 25 Billion unneeded dollars for political purposes  without talking about the Universal Mail-In Ballot Scam....
If the Democrats would stop being obstructionists and come together we could write up and agree to new immigration laws in less than one hour. Look at the needless  pain and suffering that they are causing. Look at the horrors taking place on the Border. Chuck & Nancy call me!
Without more Republicans in Congress we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally after many years of depletion take care of our Military. Sadly we needed some Dem votes for passage. Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election!
The Democrats are forcing the breakup of families at the Border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. Any Immigration Bill MUST HAVE full funding for the Wall end Catch & Release Visa Lottery and Chain and go to Merit Based Immigration. Go for it! WIN!
Congratulations to two great and hardworking guys Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie on the success of their just out book "Let Trump Be Trump." Finally people with real knowledge are writing about our wonderful and exciting campaign!
So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were "leaked" to the media. No questions on Collusion. Oh I see...you have a made up phony crime Collusion that never existed and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. Nice!
I am sorry to have to reiterate that there are serious and unpleasant consequences to crossing the Border into the United States ILLEGALLY! If there were no serious consequences our country would be overrun with people trying to get in and our system could not handle it!
...with our Country the United States Military Government Contractors and Grantees. Americans should be taught to take PRIDE in our Great Country and if you don’t there’s nothing in it for you!
This deal could NEVER have been made 3 days ago. There needed to be some "tough" love in order to get it done. Great for everybody. Proud of all!
....ever. Had to rebuild our military which was totally depleted. Fed Rate UP taxes and regulations WAY DOWN. If Dems won in 2016 the USA would be in big economic (Depression?) & military trouble right now. THE BEST IS YET TO COME. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
How can "Senator" Richard Blumenthal who went around for twenty years as a Connecticut politician bragging that he was a great Marine war hero in Vietnam (then got caught and sobbingly admitted he was neither a Marine nor ever in Vietnam) pass judgement on anyone? Loser!
Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster. Even testing areas are way off. The Dems talk of foreign influence in voting but they know that Mail-In Voting is an easy way for foreign countries to enter the race. Even beyond that there’s no accurate count!
Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans...got not one Democrat Vote! Here’s a choice. They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts!
Study what General Pershing of the United States did to terrorists when caught. There was no more Radical Islamic Terror for 35 years!
After 7 months of investigations & committee hearings about my "collusion with the Russians"  nobody has been able to show any proof. Sad!
Al Sharpton would always ask me to go to his events. He would say "it’s a personal favor to me." Seldom but sometimes I would go. It was fine. He came to my office in T.T. during the presidential campaign to apologize for the way he was talking about me. Just a conman at work!
The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don’t exist). They are totally unhinged and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can’t believe they are saying. Truly bad people!
The deal I just made with China is by far the greatest and biggest deal ever made for our Great Patriot Farmers in the history of our Country. In fact there is a question as to whether or not this much product can be produced? Our farmers will figure it out. Thank you China!
Why is Congress scheduled to meet (on Post Office) next Monday during the Republican Convention rather than now while the Dems are having their Convention. They are always playing games. GET TOUGH REPUBLICANS!!!
Leaving Minneapolis for a quick stop in Duluth to celebrate the opening of the Obama CLOSED Iron Range. My great honor!!!
Lyin’ Brian Williams of MSDNC a Concast Scam Company wouldn’t know the truth if it was nailed to his wooden forehead. Remember when he lied about his bravery in a helicopter? Totally made up story. He’s a true dummy who was thrown off Network News like a dog. Stay tuned!
Saudi Arabia and Russia are arguing over the price and flow of oil. That and the Fake News is the reason for the market drop!
Received so many Congratulations from so many on our Big Victory last night including from foreign nations (friends) that were waiting me out and hoping on Trade Deals. Now we can all get back to work and get things done!
So sad that Elijah Cummings has been able to do so little for the people of Baltimore. Statistically Baltimore ranks last in almost every major category. Cummings has done nothing but milk Baltimore dry but the public is getting wise to the bad job that he is doing!
Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard. Must be proactive!
....countries which are doing badly. I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want safety and security for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military not do a Dem defund....
With the wonderful College University and other Graduations taking place all over the USA there has never been a better time than now to graduate. Best jobs market ever great housing and financing. Go out there work hard & have a GREAT life. You deserve it. Congratulations!
The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess. They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want. They are a disgrace to our Nation and don’t...
Why would Nancy Pelosi leave the Country with other Democrats on a seven day excursion when 800000 great people are not getting paid. Also could somebody please explain to Nancy & her "big donors" in wine country that people working on farms (grapes) will have easy access in!
Big 4th of July Air Show soon coming down the East Coast. Get ready to look up to the sky. Check local listings!
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer was on a late night show using a false talking point over & over again. "We don’t have enough testing " he would repeat when he knows we have done a great job on Testing just like we have on Ventilators and everything else. He lied gave NY SALT. Run AOC!
Received a very nice call from @GovTimWalz of Minnesota. We are working closely on getting him all he needs and fast. Good things happening!
Watching Hurricane closely. My team which has done and is doing such a good job in Texas is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!
Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who in almost all cases do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight.....
My son Donald openly gave his e-mails to the media & authorities whereas Crooked Hillary Clinton deleted (& acid washed) her 33000 e-mails!
On the recommendation of the White House CoronaVirus Task Force and upon consultation with the Governor’s of New York New Jersey and Connecticut I have asked the @CDCgov to issue a strong Travel Advisory to be administered by the Governors in consultation with the....
A Federal Judge is allowing the Nick Sandman libel suit to move forward against the thoroughly disgusting Washington Post (which is no longer available at the White House!). He could now have a good chance of winning. Go Nick!
"I’d strip the whole bunch of them. They’re all corrupt. They’ve all abused their power. They’ve all betrayed the American people with a political agenda. They tried to steal and influence an election in the United States." @seanhannity
Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base. They don’t want to do it but are powerless!
Obama is lucky he ran against @MittRomney a man with very little talent or political skill as opposed to someone who knows how to fight and win!
The Wall is being built and is well under construction. Big impact will be made. Many additional contracts are close to being signed. Far ahead of schedule despite all of the Democrat Obstruction and Fake News!
Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A.M.
"The FBI only looked at 3000 of 675000 Crooked Hillary Clinton Emails." They purposely didn’t look at the disasters. This news is just out. @FoxNews
Soon heading to West Point Graduation to give the Commencement Address. Will be shown live on @FoxNews plus. Enjoy!
Where is the Whistleblower who gave so much false information? Must testify along with Schiff and others!
James Comey is a disgrace to the FBI & will go down as the worst Director in its long and once proud history. He brought the FBI down almost all Republicans & Democrats thought he should be FIRED but the FBI will regain greatness because of the great men & women who work there!
How do you impeach a President who has helped create perhaps the greatest economy in the history of our Country? All time best unemployment numbers especially for Blacks Hispanics Asians & Women. More people working today than ever before. Rebuilt Military & Choice for Vets...
Nothing done wrong READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!
In our Country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but when it comes to Border Security and the Military the Democrats fight to the death. We won on the Military which is being completely rebuilt. One way or the other we will win on the Wall!
The DEMOCRATS have given us the weakest immigration laws anywhere in the World. Mexico has the strongest & they make more than $100 Billion a year on the U.S. Therefore CONGRESS MUST CHANGE OUR WEAK IMMIGRATION LAWS NOW & Mexico must stop illegals from entering the U.S....
How many more Never Trumpers will be allowed to testify about a perfectly appropriate phone call when all anyone has to do is READ THE TRANSCRIPT! I knew people were listening in on the call (why would I say something inappropriate?) which was fine with me but why so many?
90% of the Drugs coming into the United States come through Mexico & our Southern Border. 80000 people died last year 1000000 people ruined. This has gone on for many years & nothing has been done about it. We have a 100 Billion Dollar Trade Deficit with Mexico. It’s time!
Crazy Maxine Waters: "After we impeach Trump we’ll go after Mike Pence. We’ll get him."  @FoxNews  Where are the Democrats coming from? The best Economy in the history of our country would totally collapse if they ever took control!
Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube’s HQ in San Bruno California. Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved. Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene.
Thank you to brilliant and highly respected attorney Alan Dershowitz for destroying the very dumb legal argument of "Judge" Andrew Napolitano....
HISTORIC rainfall in Houston and all over Texas. Floods are unprecedented and more rain coming. Spirit of the people is incredible.Thanks!
So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written). Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work? I don’t think so!
Thanks @RandPaul  "I am very proud of the President. This is exactly what he promised and I think the people agree with him. We’ve been at war too long and in too many places...spent several trillion dollars on these wars everywhere. He’s different...that’s why he got elected."
Why don’t the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world’s worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs including MS-13 coming into our country illegally?
House Republicans could easily pass a Bill on Strong Border Security but remember it still has to pass in the Senate and for that we need 10 Democrat votes and all they do is RESIST. They want Open Borders and don’t care about Crime! Need more Republicans to WIN in November!
Democrats are the problem. They don’t care about crime and want illegal immigrants no matter how bad they may be to pour into and infest our Country like MS-13. They can’t win on their terrible policies so they view them as potential voters!
Thousands of people are already lined up in Orlando some two days before tomorrow nights big Rally. Large Screens and food trucks will be there for those that can’t get into the 25000 capacity arena. It will be a very exciting evening! Make America Great Again!
Washed up Creepster John Bolton is a lowlife who should be in jail money seized for disseminating for profit highly Classified information. Remember what they did to the young submarine sailor but did nothing to Crooked Hillary. I ended up pardoning him - It wasn’t fair!
Big announcement by Ford today. Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants. Car companies coming back to U.S.  JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!
Stock Market up big. New and Historic Record. Job jobs jobs!
Nancy Pelosi just said "I don’t know if we can be ready this week." In other words it’s off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. That’s been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!
The trip by @VP Pence was long planned. He is receiving great praise for leaving game after the players showed such disrespect for country!
...rounds no problem. When I play Fake News CNN and others park themselves anywhere they can to get a picture then scream "President Trump is playing golf." Actually I play VERY fast get a lot of work done on the golf course and also get a "tiny" bit of exercise. Not bad!
....for electric cars. General Motors made a big China bet years ago when they built plants there (and in Mexico) - don’t think that bet is going to pay off. I am here to protect America’s Workers!
The Great Patriots of Rolling Thunder WILL be coming back to Washington D.C. next year & hopefully for many years to come. It is where they want to be & where they should be. Have a wonderful time today. Thank you to our great men & women of the Pentagon for working it out!
We must maintain a Strong Southern Border. We cannot allow our Country to be overrun by illegal immigrants as the Democrats tell their phony stories of sadness and grief hoping it will help them in the elections. Obama and others had the same pictures and did nothing about it!
The Failing New York Times has knowingly written a very inaccurate story on my intentions on Syria. No different from my original statements we will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!.....
2018 is being called "THE YEAR OF THE WORKER" by Steve Moore co-author of "Trumponomics." It was indeed a great year for the American Worker with the "best job market in 50 years and the lowest unemployment rate ever for blacks and Hispanics and all workers. Big wage gains."
Democrats going back to their Districts for Thanksgiving are getting absolutely hammered by their constituents over the phony Impeachment Scam. Republicans will have a great #2020 Election!
REMEMBER THE MIDTERMS!
Great evening last night in Washington Michigan. The enthusiasm knowledge and love in that room was unreal. To the many thousands of people who couldn’t get in I cherish you....and will be back!
Bernie Sander’s volunteers are trashing Elizabeth "Pocahontus" Warren. Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters. Mini Mike B is also trying but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?
Democrats must change the Immigration Laws FAST. If not Sanctuary Cities must immediately ACT to take care of the Illegal Immigrants - and this includes Gang Members Drug Dealers Human Traffickers and Criminals of all shapes sizes and kinds. CHANGE THE LAWS NOW!
The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!
Adam Schiff will be compelled to testify should the Democrats decide despite the fact that my presidential conversations were totally appropriate (perfect) to go forward with the Impeachment Hoax. Polls have now turned very strongly against Impeachment!
Last time I went to Davos the Fake News said I should not go there. This year because of the Shutdown I decided not to go and the Fake News said I should be there. The fact is that the people understand the media better than the media understands them!
Highest Stock Market In History By Far!
The Wall Street Journal story on the China Deal is completely wrong especially their statement on Tariffs. Fake News. They should find a better leaker!
The U.S. won a $7.5 Billion award from the World Trade Organization against the European Union who has for many years treated the USA very badly on Trade due to Tariffs Trade Barriers and more. This case going on for years a nice victory!
The story today that we are sending 12000 troops to Saudi Arabia is false or to put it more accurately Fake News!
Biden losing big in Florida. Only Fake Polls show otherwise! Bad for Healthcare. Thinks he’s running for the Senate. Forgot Mitt Romney’s name and where he was!
What ever happened to the Server at the center of so much Corruption that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI? They broke into homes & offices early in the morning but were afraid to take the Server?
Always heard that as President "it’s all about the economy!" Well we have one of the best economies in the history of our Country. Big GDP lowest unemployment companies coming back to the U.S. in BIG numbers great new trade deals happening & more. But LITTLE media mention!
Wow! The NSA has deleted 685 million phone calls and text messages. Privacy violations? They blame technical irregularities. Such a disgrace. The Witch Hunt continues!
Wow! 100000 Mail In Ballots in New York City a total MESS. Mayor and Governor have no idea what to do. Big Fraud Unfixable! Cancel Ballots and go out and VOTE just like in past decades when there were no problems!
Watched MSNBC this morning just to see what the opposition was saying about events of the past week. Such lies almost everything they were saying was the opposite of the truth. Fake News! No wonder their ratings along with CNN are WAY DOWN. The hatred Comcast has is amazing!
My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee. I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.
If Chelsea Clinton were asked to hold the seat for her motheras her mother gave our country away the Fake News would say CHELSEA FOR PRES!
"Billionaire Tech Investor Peter Thiel believes Google should be investigated for treason. He accuses Google of working with the Chinese Government." @foxandfriends  A great and brilliant guy who knows this subject better than anyone! The Trump Administration will take a look!
The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France 26% and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. He was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way there is no country more Nationalist than France very proud people-and rightfully so!........
"The Senate shall set the time and place of the trial." If the Do Nothing Democrats decide in their great wisdom not to show up they would lose by Default!
Working hard to get the Olympics for the United States (L.A.). Stay tuned!
....What does it mean for America to have free Healthcare for Illegal Immigrants no criminalization of coming into our Country - See how that works for controlling Immigration! They talk about Israel like they’re a bunch of thugs not victims of the entire region. They wanted...
....had happened to a Presidential candidate or President who was a Democrat everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more) and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!
When I terminated John Kelly which I couldn’t do fast enough he knew full well that he was way over his head. Being Chief of Staff just wasn’t for him. He came in with a bang went out with a whimper but like so many X’s he misses the action & just can’t keep his mouth shut.
The Whistleblower must come forward to explain why his account of the phone call with the Ukrainian President was so inaccurate (fraudulent?). Why did the Whistleblower deal with corrupt politician Shifty Adam Schiff and/or his committee?
Heading over to Vietnam for my meeting with Kim Jong Un. Looking forward to a very productive Summit!
Democrats in the Senate are still slow walking hundreds of highly qualified people wanting to come into government. Never been such an abuse in our country’s history. Mitch should not let Senate go home until all are approved. We need our Ambassadors and all others NOW!
So funny to watch Steve Kerr grovel and pander when asked a simple question about China. He chocked and looks weak and pathetic. Don’t want him at the White House!
...also coming back in record numbers. We are leading the World in Economic Recovery and THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
Just left Dayton Ohio where I met with the Victims & families Law Enforcement Medical Staff & First Responders. It was a warm & wonderful visit. Tremendous enthusiasm & even Love. Then I saw failed Presidential Candidate (0%) Sherrod Brown & Mayor Whaley totally.....
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
Finally Liddle’ Adam Schiff the leakin’ monster of no control is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election. He is finally right about something. Obama was President knew of the threat and did nothing. Thank you Adam!
Democrats can’t impeach a Republican President for crimes committed by Democrats. The facts are "pouring" in. The Greatest Witch Hunt in American History! Congress go back to work and help us at the Border with Drug Prices and on Infrastructure.
"President Trump’s decision to very early on restrict travel from China saved tens of thousands of lives."  @LouDobbs @FoxBusiness
Iranian Foreign Minister says Iran wants to negotiate with The United States but wants sanctions removed. @FoxNews  @OANN No Thanks!
How dare failed Presidential Candidate (1% and falling!) @CoryBooker make false charges and statements about me in addressing Judge Barrett. Illegally never even lived in Newark when he was Mayor. Guy is a total loser! I want better Healthcare for far less money always.....
White House news conference at 6:45 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
Mini Mike "Three months ago I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump (and I failed miserably!).
Just left West Palm Beach Fire & Rescue #2. Met with great men and women as representatives of those who do so much for all of us. Firefighters paramedics first responders - what amazing people they are!
.@NateSilver538  "The Trump 2016 Victory was the most shocking political development of my lifetime." That’s only because you got it  so wrong. This time there is far more ENTHUSIASM even than 2016. Winning many States much more easily than people understand. BIG CROWDS!!!
The WTO is BROKEN when the world’s RICHEST countries claim to be developing countries to avoid WTO rules and get special treatment. NO more!!! Today I directed the U.S. Trade Representative to take action so that countries stop CHEATING the system at the expense of the USA!
When referring to the USA I will always capitalize the word Country!
...caused over so many years. Any attack by Iran in any form against the United States will be met with an attack on Iran that will be 1000 times greater in magnitude!
We shouldn’t have to buy our friends with bad Trade Deals and Free Military Protection!
General Kelly is doing a great job at the border. Numbers are way down. Many are not even trying to come in anymore.
Camp David is a very special place. An honor to have spent the weekend there. Military runs it so well and are so proud of what they do!
Retail sales are at record numbers. We’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven’t seen anything yet!
Outrage is growing in the Great State of Minnesota where our Patriots are now having to fight for the right to say the Pledge of Allegiance. I will be fighting with you! @foxandfriends
Did Hillary Clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate? Just asking!
Big protests in Iran. The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism. Looks like they will not take it any longer. The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations!
The White House Correspondents’ Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night!
Sorry folks but if I would have relied on the Fake News of CNN NBC ABC CBS washpost or nytimes I would have had ZERO chance winning WH
Great success today at NATO! Billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election. Great spirit!
Getting ready for my big foreign trip. Will be strongly protecting American interests - that's what I like to do!
The economy is doing great. More people working in U.S.A. today than at any time in our HISTORY. Media barely covers! @foxandfriends
When will they open a Cold Case on the Psycho Joe Scarborough matter in Florida. Did he get away with murder? Some people think so. Why did he leave Congress so quietly and quickly? Isn’t it obvious? What’s happening now? A total nut job!
"Very troubled by Durham probe findings." A.G. Bill Barr  @BretBaier  @FoxNews
"Former CIA analyst Larry Johnson accuses United Kingdom Intelligence of helping Obama Administration Spy on the 2016 Trump Presidential Campaign." @OANN WOW! It is now just a question of time before the truth comes out and when it does it will be a beauty!
.....close the Southern Border. Bring our car industry back into the United States where it belongs. Go back to pre-NAFTA before so many of our companies and jobs were so foolishly sent to Mexico. Either we build (finish) the Wall or we close the Border......
Dow Jones has best week of the year!
Just talked with Pfizer CEO and @SecAzar on our drug pricing blueprint. Pfizer is rolling back price hikes so American patients don’t pay more. We applaud Pfizer for this decision and hope other companies do the same. Great news for the American people!
"Scandal has defined the Obama Administration." @LisaMarieBoothe @ffweekend
Will be heading to El Paso very soon. Big speech on Border Security and much else tonight. Tremendous crowd! See you later!
....Coyotes and Illegal Immigrants which they can do very easily or our many companies and jobs that have been foolishly allowed to move South of the Border will be brought back into the United States through taxation (Tariffs). America has had enough!
I don’t care what the political ramifications are our immigration laws and border security have been a complete and total disaster for decades and there is no way that the Democrats will allow it to be fixed without a Government Shutdown...
Stock Market Up Big. Do I get no credit for this? Never even mentioned by the Fake News. A New Record for Stocks and Jobs Growth. Remember "it’s the Economy Stupid".  VOTE!!!
No matter what you give to the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats it will never be enough!
White House news conference at 5:00 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
The White House is running very smoothly and the results for our Nation are obviously very good. We are the envy of the world. But anytime I even think about making changes the FAKE NEWS MEDIA goes crazy always seeking to make us look as bad as possible! Very dishonest!
The United States will be immediately implementing much tougher Extreme Vetting Procedures. The safety of our citizens comes first!
I had a GREAT meeting with Putin and the Fake News used every bit of their energy to try and disparage it. So bad for our country!
Republicans have never been more unified than they are right now! The Dems are a mess under the corrupt leadership of Nervous Nancy Pelosi and Shifty Adam Schiff!
So pathetic to see Sleepy Joe Biden who with his son Hunter and to the detriment of the American Taxpayer has ripped off at least two countries for millions of dollars calling for my impeachment - and I did nothing wrong. Joe’s Failing Campaign gave him no other choice!
Trade negotiators have just returned from China where the meetings on Trade were very productive. Now at meetings with me at Mar-a-Lago giving the details. In the meantime Billions of Dollars are being paid to the United States by China in the form of Trade Tariffs!
"For the first time in history Police Organizations & National Security Organizations were used to SPY on a Campaign & there was no basis for it. The media largely drove that & claims were made that could have affected the election of the President." A.G. Bill Barr @BretBaier
Is everybody believing what is going on. James Comey can’t define what a leak is. He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is. He lied all over the place to cover it up. He’s either very sick or very dumb. Remember sailor!
I will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. @FoxNews  Enjoy!
....And to Joy his wonderful wife who he loved so much my warmest condolences!!!
Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth. Perhaps that’s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition!
The Defense Production Act is in full force but haven’t had to use it because no one has said NO! Millions of masks coming as back up to States.
The White House CoronaVirus Task Force headed by Vice President Mike Pence has done a fantastic job of bringing together vast highly complex resources that have set a high standard for others to follow in the future. Ventilators which were few & in bad shape are now being....
Best unemployment numbers in the history of our Country. Best employment number EVER almost 160 million people working right now. Vote Republican unless you want to see these numbers obliterated!
Those Illegal Immigrants who can no longer be legally held (Congress must fix the laws and loopholes) will be subject to Homeland Security given to Sanctuary Cities and States!
....would destroy our American cities and worse if Sleepy Joe Biden the puppet of the Left ever won. Markets would crash and cities would burn. Our Country would suffer like never before. We will beat the Virus soon and go on to the Golden Age - better than ever before!
My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before....
....We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S. and our TAXPAYERS on Trade. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO and it is being fixed!
With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration there was never a special counsel appointed!
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Thank you!
Wow! CNN Ratings are WAY DOWN record lows. People are getting tired of so many Fake Stories and Anti-Trump lies. Chris Cuomo was rewarded for lowest morning ratings with a prime time spot - which is failing badly and not helping the dumbest man on television Don Lemon!
Heading to Minnesota today. Saved Minneapolis after the Dem LEFT almost let it be TOTALLY destroyed! #MAGA
Congratulations to Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith on your big WIN in the Great State of Mississippi. We are all very proud of you!
The only problem I have with Mitch McConnell is that after hearing Repeal & Replace for 7 years he failed!That should NEVER have happened!
....You will see it was a very friendly and totally appropriate call. No pressure and unlike Joe Biden and his son NO quid pro quo! This is nothing more than a continuation of the Greatest and most Destructive Witch Hunt of all time!
Stock Market could hit all-time high (again) 22000 today. Was 18000 only 6 months ago on Election Day. Mainstream media seldom mentions!
Massive amounts of medical supplies even hospitals and medical centers are being delivered directly to states and hospitals by the Federal Government. Some have insatiable appetites & are never satisfied (politics?). Remember we are a backup for them. The complainers should...
President Obama’s top White House lawyer Gregory B. Craig was indicted yesterday on very serious charges. This is a really big story but the Fake News New York Times didn’t even put it on page one rather page 16. @washingtonpost not much better "tiny" page one. Corrupt News!
Getting ready to land in the Great State of Arizona!
Before I arrived in France the Fake and Disgusting News was saying that relations with the 6 others countries in the G-7 are very tense and that the two days of meetings will be a disaster. Just like they are trying to force a Recession they are trying to "will" America into..
Why doesn’t @FoxNews put up the CNBC POLL or the (believe it or not!) @CNN Poll? Hope Roger A is looking down and watching what has happened to this once beautiful creation!
Russia Syria and Iran are killing or on their way to killing thousands of innocent civilians in Idlib Province. Don’t do it! Turkey is working hard to stop this carnage.
The Democrats are demanding Mail-In Ballots because the enthusiasm meter for Slow Joe Biden is the lowest in recorded history and they are concerned that very few people will turn out to vote. Instead they will search & find people then "harvest" & return Ballots. Not fair!
General John Kelly totally agrees w/ my stance on NFL players and the fact that they should not be disrespecting our FLAG or GREAT COUNTRY!
Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal even going at it with President Obama & then Voted AGAINST it! Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that! Same with Comey. Thought he was terrible until I fired him!
National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day - "A day that will live in infamy!" December 7 1941
When the time is right we will make a deal with China. My respect and friendship with President Xi is unlimited but as I have told him many times before this must be a great deal for the United States or it just doesn’t make any sense. We have to be allowed to make up some.....
Wall Street Journal: "More migrant families crossing into the U.S. illegally have been arrested in the first five months of the federal fiscal year than in any prior full year." We are doing a great job at the border but this is a National Emergency!
....mentally ill or deranged people. I am the biggest Second Amendment person there is but we all must work together for the good and safety of our Country. Common sense things can be done that are good for everyone!
The train accident that just occurred in DuPont WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly. Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads bridges tunnels railways (and more) crumble! Not for long!
Wow NFL first game ratings are way down over an already really bad last year comparison. Viewership declined 13% the lowest in over a decade. If the players stood proudly for our Flag and Anthem and it is all shown on broadcast maybe ratings could come back? Otherwise worse!
U.S. Stock Market up almost 20% since Election!
Fantastic numbers on consumer spending released on Friday. Stock Market hits all time high!
Nancy and Cryin’ Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their and the Democrats fault!
Joe Biden delivered remarks to union members after spending 47 years giving their jobs to China and foreign countries in exchange for campaign cash...
I spoke at length yesterday to Rabbi Yisroel Goldstein Chabad  of Poway where I extended my warmest condolences to him and all affected by the shooting in California. What a great guy. He had a least one finger blown off and all he wanted to do is help others. Very special!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
If a new HealthCare Bill is not approved quickly BAILOUTS for Insurance Companies and BAILOUTS for Members of Congress will end very soon!
"I don’t think there’s any chance whatsoever of Senator Sanders defeating President Trump." Mini Mike Bloomberg. Mini there’s even less chance especially after watching your debate performance last night of you winning the Democrat nomination...But I hope you do!
Unbelievably James Comey states that Polls where Crooked Hillary was leading were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe. In other words he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win and he wanted a job. Slimeball!
....If a potential "sicko shooter" knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting the sicko will NEVER attack that school. Cowards won’t go there...problem solved. Must be offensive defense alone won’t work!
Why didn’t the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton many crimes much Collusion with Russia? Why didn’t the FBI take the Server from the DNC?  Rigged Investigation!
The United States has a great economic story to tell. Number one in the World by far!
"This President has done more for African Americans in this Country than any President since Lincoln." @LouDobbs
The travel ban into the United States should be far larger tougher and more specific-but stupidly that would not be politically correct!
The incompetent Mayor of London Sadiq Khan was bothered that I played a very fast round of golf yesterday. Many Pols exercise for hours or travel for weeks. Me I run through one of my courses (very inexpensive). President Obama would fly to Hawaii. Kahn should focus on....
I will be representing our Country in London at NATO while the Democrats are holding the most ridiculous Impeachment hearings in history. Read the Transcripts NOTHING was done or said wrong! The Radical Left is undercutting our Country. Hearings scheduled on same dates as NATO!
If Biden’s Polling wasn’t going down and fast he wouldn’t be going to Pittsburgh.
Honoring the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to America. Home of the free because of the brave. #MemorialDay🇺🇸
United States weekly jobless claims just hit a 50 year low. The economy is doing GREAT!
A recent Emerson College ePoll said that most Americans especially Hispanics feel that they are better off under President Trump than they were under President Obama.
Don't give up Republican Senators the World is watching: Repeal & Replace...and go to 51 votes (nuke option) get Cross State Lines & more.
Thank you @marcorubio for helping to expose the potential corruption going on with respect to Election Theft in Broward and Palm Beach Counties. The WORLD is now watching closely!
Without a Wall our Country can never have Border or National Security. With a powerful Wall or Steel Barrier Crime Rates (and Drugs) will go substantially down all over the U.S. The Dems know this but want to play political games. Must finally be done correctly. No Cave!
I want to encourage all of my many Texas friends to vote in the primary for Governor Greg Abbott Senator Ted Cruz Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton. They are helping me to Make America Great Again! Vote early or on March 6th.
The meeting between President Putin and myself was a great success except in the Fake News Media!
I’ve been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!
Another Fake Story on @NBCNews that I offered Pardons to Homeland Securiy personnel in case they broke the law regarding illegal immigration and sanctuary cities. Of course this is not true. Mainstream Media is corrupt and getting worse if that is possible every day!
When Lisa Page the lover of Peter Strzok talks about being "crushed" and how innocent she is ask her to read Peter’s "Insurance Policy" text to her just in case Hillary loses. Also why were the lovers text messages scrubbed after he left Mueller. Where are they Lisa?
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council? Therefore the Special Council was established based on an illegal act? Really does everybody know what that means?
The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on. At some point this had to be done!
Longest bull run in the history of the stock market congratulations America!
One of the many great things about our just signed giant Trade Deal with China is that it will bring both the USA & China closer together in so many other ways. Terrific working with President Xi a man who truly loves his country. Much more to come!
Wall Street Journal Editorial: "She (Crazy Nancy) aimed at Trump and hit Uncle Joe."
....productive talks I will be delaying the U.S. increase in tariffs now scheduled for March 1. Assuming both sides make additional progress we will be planning a Summit for President Xi and myself at Mar-a-Lago to conclude an agreement. A very good weekend for U.S. & China!
Ex-NSA contractor to spend 63 months in jail over "classified" information. Gee this is "small potatoes" compared to what Hillary Clinton did! So unfair Jeff Double Standard.
After the worst debate performance in the history of politics Michael Bloomberg commonly known as Mini Mike is trying to make a comeback by begging the Democrats for relevance. They treated him like a dog - and always will. Before politics he said GREAT things about me!
"The President has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case." A.G. Barr  This doesn’t mean that I do not have as President the legal right to do so I do but I have so far chosen not to!
Rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50% which is higher than Obama and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are "somewhat low." They know they are lying when they say it. Turn off the show - FAKE NEWS!
Pelosi is now leading a delegation of 9 including Corrupt Adam Schiff to Jordan to check out Syria. She should find out why Obama drew The Red Line In the Sand & then did NOTHING losing Syria & all respect. I did something 58 missiles. One million died under Obama’s mistake!
Democrats in Congress must vote to close the terrible loopholes at the Southern Border. If not harsh measures will have to be taken!
Can you believe that Mitch McConnell who has screamed Repeal & Replace for 7 years couldn't get it done. Must Repeal & Replace ObamaCare!
Big Rally tomorrow night in Orlando Florida looks to be setting records. We are building large movie screens outside to take care of everybody. Over 100000 requests. Our Country is doing great far beyond what the haters & losers thought possible - and it will only get better!
Mexico whose laws on immigration are very tough must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U.S. We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement. Our Country cannot accept what is happening! Also we must get Wall funding fast.
The U.S. will soon control 100% of ISIS territory in Syria. @CNN (do you believe this?).
Elect more Republicans in  November and we will pass the finest fairest and most comprehensive Immigration Bills anywhere in the world. Right now we have the dumbest and the worst. Dems are doing nothing but Obstructing. Remember their motto RESIST! Ours is PRODUCE!
The House Democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the Republicans on their Impeachment Hoax. The Republicans have never been so united!  The Dem’s case is so bad that they don’t even want to go to trial!
The Democrats are only interested in BAILING OUT their badly managed high crime Blue States. They are not interested in our workers or small businesses. Crazy Nancy will only do stimulus which would be helpful if we couple it with bailout money. Republican States are great!!!
Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 11:30 A.M. to discuss School Safety.  Next week it will be with our Nation’s Governors. It’s been many years of all talk no action. We’ll get it done!
Only Fake Polls show us behind the Motley Crew. We are looking really good but it is far too early to be focused on that. Much work to do! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
The greatest overreach in the history of our Country. The Dems are obstructing justice and will not get anything done. A big fat fishing expedition desperately in search of a crime when in fact the real crime is what the Dems are doing and have done!
They didn’t want John Bolton and others in the House. They were in too much of a rush. Now they want them all in the Senate. Not supposed to be that way!
....There is nothing to admire about them they will always try to show a glimmer of vicious hope but they are losers and barely breathing. Think about that before you destroy your lives and the lives of your family!
The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime. All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their "pockets." The people have little food big inflation and no human rights. The U.S. is watching!
Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014 long before my run for President. Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know!
I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
READ THE TRANSCRIPT!
Will be leaving for Dover to be with the families of 4 very special people who lost their lives in service to our Country!
Many will disagree but @FoxNews is doing nothing to help Republicans and me get re-elected on November 3rd. Sure there are some truly GREAT people on Fox but you also have some real "garbage" littered all over the network people like Dummy Juan Williams Schumerite Chris...
....asking Hillary Clinton why she deleted and acid washed her Emails AFTER getting a subpoena from Congress? Anybody else would be in jail for that yet the Dems refuse to even bring it up. Rigged House Committee
Wow just called! @TTuberville - Tommy Tuberville WON big against Jeff Sessions. Will be a GREAT Senator for the incredible people of Alabama. @DougJones is a terrible Senator who is just a Super Liberal puppet for Schumer & Pelosi. Represents Alabama poorly. On to November 3rd.
There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal. If we don’t make a fair deal for the U.S. after decades of abuse Canada will be out. Congress should not interfere w/ these negotiations or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely & we will be far better off...
I know President Xi of China very well. He is a great leader who very much has the respect of his people. He is also a good man in a "tough business." I have ZERO doubt that if President Xi wants to quickly and humanely solve the Hong Kong problem he can do it. Personal meeting?
At a recent round table meeting of business executives & long after formally introducing Tim Cook of Apple I quickly referred to Tim + Apple as Tim/Apple as an easy way to save time & words. The Fake News was disparagingly all over this & it became yet another bad Trump story!
Federal Government is working very well with the Governors and State officials. Good things will happen! #KILLTHEVIRUS
We would save Billions of Dollars if the Democrats would give us the votes to build the Wall. Either way people will NOT be allowed into our Country illegally! We will close the entire Southern Border if necessary. Also STOP THE DRUGS!
African Americans are very angry at the double standard on full display in Virginia!
Sleepy Joe Biden (mostly his reps.) went crazy when I banned in late January people coming in from China. He called me "xenophobic" & then went equally "nuts" when we let in 44000 people - until he was told they were American citizens coming home. He later apologized!
NASDAQ UP 27% THIS YEAR ALONE!
I am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate Gene Scalia as the new Secretary of Labor. Gene has led a life of great success in the legal and labor field and is highly respected not only as a lawyer but as a lawyer with great experience....
My warmest condolences to the family and many friends of Congressman Elijah Cummings. I got to see first hand the strength passion and wisdom of this highly respected political leader. His work and voice on so many fronts will be very hard if not impossible to replace!
Patrick Moore co-founder of Greenpeace: "The whole climate crisis is not only Fake News it’s Fake Science. There is no climate crisis there’s weather and climate all around the world and in fact carbon dioxide is the main building block of all life." @foxandfriends  Wow!
So many people are asking why isn't the A.G. or Special Council looking at the many Hillary Clinton or Comey crimes. 33000 e-mails deleted?
The Fake News Washington Post and even more Fake News New York Times are writing stories that there is infighting with respect to my strong policy in the Middle East. There is no infighting whatsoever....
To the Great people of Alaska. You have been hit hard by a "big one." Please follow the directions of the highly trained professionals who are there to help you. Your Federal Government will spare no expense. God Bless you ALL!
Hasn’t Adam Schiff been fully discredited by now? Do we have to continue listening to his lies?
"The evidence has to be overwhelming and it is not. It’s not even close." Ken Starr Former Independent Counsel
Nevada I hear you on Yucca Mountain and my Administration will RESPECT you! Congress and previous Administrations have long failed to find lasting solutions – my Administration is committed to exploring innovative approaches – I’m confident we can get it done!
"Yesterday changed everything it really did clear the President. He wins." @ainsleyearhardt  "It changed everything in favor of the President who said all along this investigation is rooted in nothing. Mueller was exposed as being best friends with Comey. Today you say.....
So funny to see the CNN Fake Suppression Polls and false rhetoric. Watch for real results Tuesday. We are lucky CNN’s ratings are so low. Don’t fall for the Suppression Game. Go out & VOTE. Remember we now have perhaps the greatest Economy (JOBS) in the history of our Country!
Democrats are laughingly saying that McCain had a "moment of courage." Tell that to the people of Arizona who were deceived. 116% increase!
Hearing that Iran is looking to execute a great and popular wrestling star 27-year-old Navid Afkarai whose sole act was an anti-government demonstration on the streets. They were protesting the "country’s worsening economic situation and inflation"...
The United States has spent EIGHT TRILLION DOLLARS fighting and policing in the Middle East. Thousands of our Great Soldiers have died or been badly wounded. Millions of people have died on the other side. GOING INTO THE MIDDLE EAST IS THE WORST DECISION EVER MADE.....
Sleepy Joe Biden refuses to leave his basement "sanctuary" and tell his Radical Left BOSSES that they are heading in the wrong direction. Tell them to get out of Seattle now. Liberal Governor @JayInslee is looking "the fool". LAW & ORDER!
Presidential Harassment!
....serving and doing a great job as your President (including accepting Zero salary!).
We shouldn’t be hiring judges by the thousands as our ridiculous immigration laws demand we should be changing our laws building the Wall hire Border Agents and Ice and not let people come into our country based on the legal phrase they are told to say as their password.
Attorney–client privilege is dead!
Back from Miami where my Cuban/American friends are very happy with what I signed today. Another campaign promise that I did not forget!
Great to be back on track with the European Union. This was a big day for free and fair trade!
"Border Patrol Agents want the Wall." Democrat’s say they don’t want the Wall (even though they know it is really needed) and they don’t want ICE. They don’t have much to campaign on do they? An Open Southern Border and the large scale crime that comes with such stupidity!
The story in the New York Times regarding Jim Webb being considered as the next Secretary of Defense is FAKE NEWS. I’m sure he is a fine man but I don’t know Jim and never met him. Patrick Shanahan who is Acting Secretary of Defense is doing a great job!
More troops being sent to the Southern Border to stop the attempted Invasion of Illegals through large Caravans into our Country. We have stopped the previous Caravans and we will stop these also. With a Wall it would be soooo much easier and less expensive. Being Built!
....And add to that the fact that the U.S. pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh!). The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military!
.@Amazon and others in that business should be charged (by the U.S. Postal System) much more per package and the Post Office would be immediately brought back to "good health" now vibrant with ALL jobs saved. No pass on to customers. Get it done!
It is about time that Roger Goodell of the NFL is finally demanding that all players STAND for our great National Anthem-RESPECT OUR COUNTRY
The Russia hoax continues now it's ads on Facebook. What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?
Friday’s tour showed vividly to politicians and the media how well run and clean the children’s detention centers are. Great reviews! Failing @nytimes story was FAKE! The adult single men areas were clean but crowded - also loaded up with a big percentage of criminals......
To the great people of Alabama and surrounding areas: Please be careful and safe. Tornadoes and storms were truly violent and more could be coming. To the families and friends of the victims and to the injured God bless you all!
The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats said they wanted to RUSH everything through to the Senate because "President Trump is a threat to National Security" (they are vicious will say anything!) but now they don’t want to go fast anymore they want to go very slowly. Liars!
The so-called Whistleblower’s account of my perfect phone call is "way off" not even close. Schiff and Pelosi never thought I would release the transcript of the call. Got them by surprise they got caught. This is a fraud against the American people!
The WALL which is already under construction in the form of new renovation of old and existing fences and walls will continue to be built.
I had a great meeting with President Xi of China yesterday far better than expected. I agreed not to increase the already existing Tariffs that we charge China while we continue to negotiate. China has agreed that during the negotiation they will begin purchasing large.....
Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly....but in the end that doesn’t matter. We will all know soon whether or not a real deal unlike those of the past can happen!
...His primary strength was not military but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life things to do and battles to win but he seldom "brought home the bacon". I didn’t like his "leadership" style or much else about him and many others agree. Glad he is gone!
....My Administration and I built the greatest economy in history of any country turned it off saved millions of lives and now am building an even greater economy than it was before. Jobs are flowing NASDAQ is already at a record high the rest to follow. Sit back & watch!
The Biden family was PAID OFF pure and simple! The fake news must stop making excuses for something that is totally inexcusable. Sleepy Joe said he never spoke to the Ukrainian company and then the picture came out where he was playing golf with the company boss and Hunter.....
White House News Conference today at 6:00 P.M. Economy Job gains and Vaccine development are all doing GREAT!
White House news conference today at 6:00 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
"Ralph Waldo Emerson seemed to foresee the lesson of the Senate Impeachment Trial of President Trump. ‘When you strike at the King Emerson famously said "you must kill him.’ Mr. Trump’s foes struck at him but did not take him down. A triumphant Mr.Trump emerges from the.....
I’m very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don’t want Trump!
If you want your 401k’s  and Stocks which are getting close to an all time high (NASDAQ is already there) to disintegrate and disappear vote for the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats and Corrupt Joe Biden. Massive Tax Hikes - They will make you very poor FAST!
Can’t believe that Rolling Thunder would be given a hard time with permits in Washington D.C. They are great Patriots who I have gotten to know and see in action. They love our Country and love our Flag. If I can help I will!
"Democrats can’t find a Smocking Gun tying the Trump campaign to Russia after James Comey’s testimony. No Smocking Gun...No Collusion." @FoxNews  That’s because there was NO COLLUSION. So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution...
Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen will be leaving her position and I would like to thank her for her service....
White House News Conference today at 5:30 P.M. Enjoy!
The Corrupt News Media is totally out of control - they have given up and don’t even care anymore. Mainstream Media has ZERO CREDIBILITY - TOTAL LOSERS!
My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken. @Colts
On the ten-year anniversary of the Mumbai terror attack the U.S. stands with the people of India in their quest for justice. The attack killed 166 innocents including six Americans. We will never let terrorists win or even come close to winning!
Shutdown today if Democrats do not vote for Border Security!
Democrats want open Borders where anyone can come into our Country and stay. This is Nancy Pelosi’s dream. It won’t happen!
Republicans on the Homeland Security Committee are wasting their time. Democrats despite all of the evidence proof and Caravans coming are not going to give money to build the DESPERATELY needed WALL. I’ve got you covered. Wall is already being built I don’t expect much help!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Trade talks going on with numerous countries that for many years have not treated the United States fairly. In the end all will be happy!
Wisconsin please get out NOW and vote for Tom Tiffany for Congress. A great guy!
As a sign of good faith Mexico should immediately stop the flow of people and drugs through their country and to our Southern Border. They can do it if they want!
Very low ratings for the Democratic Debate last night — they’re desperate for Trump!
....about all of the one sided Fake Media coverage (collusion with Crooked H?) that I had to endure during my very successful presidential campaign. What about the now revealed bias by Facebook and many others. Roger Stone didn’t even work for me anywhere near the Election!
When President Obama said that he has been to "57 States" very little mention in Fake News Media. Can you imagine if I said that...story of the year! @IngrahamAngle
Congress get ready to do your job - DACA!
Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job. The killings are at a record pace and tough police work which Chicago will not allow would bring things back to order fast...the killings must stop!
Congratulations to Brian Kemp on becoming the new Governor of Georgia. Stacey Abrams fought brilliantly and hard - she will have a terrific political future! Brian was unrelenting and will become a great Governor for the truly Wonderful People of Georgia!
The new Rasmussen Poll one of the most accurate in the 2016 Election just out with a Trump 50% Approval Rating.That's higher than O's #'s!
Our military is building and is rapidly becoming stronger than ever before. Frankly we have no choice!
I’m hearing that the Great People of Utah are considering their vote for their Pompous Senator Mitt Romney to be a big mistake. I agree! He is a fool who is playing right into the hands of the Do Nothing Democrats! #IMPEACHMITTROMNEY
It was not a campaign contribution and there were no violations of the campaign finance laws by me. Fake News!
I never called Meghan Markle "nasty." Made up by the Fake News Media and they got caught cold! Will @CNN @nytimes and others apologize? Doubt it!
Do you notice that any time Fake News Suppression Polls are put out like @FoxNews the Stock Market goes DOWN. We are going to WIN!
....Best and Newest Military (almost totally rebuilt from the depleted military I took over) in History Best V.A. in History (Choice) and MUCH MUCH MORE. Gee let’s impeach the President. The "Squad" (AOC Plus 3) and other Dems suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. Crazy!
How is the Paris Environmental Accord working out for France? After 18 weeks of rioting by the Yellow Vest Protesters I guess not so well! In the meantime the United States has gone to the top of all lists on the Environment.
NBC FAKE NEWS which is under intense scrutiny over their killing the Harvey Weinstein story is now fumbling around making excuses for their probably highly unethical conduct. I have long criticized NBC and their journalistic standards-worse than even CNN. Look at their license?
The Economy is the BEST IT HAS EVER BEEN! Even much of the Fake News is giving me credit for that!
Tiger is playing great. Looks like a big win could happen. Very exciting! @TigerWoods
Serious discussions are taking place between House and Senate leadership  on meaningful Background Checks. I have also been speaking to the NRA and others so that their very strong views can be fully represented and respected. Guns should not be placed in the hands of.....
The pathetic and dishonest Weekly Standard run by failed prognosticator Bill Kristol (who like many others never had a clue) is flat broke and out of business. Too bad. May it rest in peace!
Plagiarism charge against Sleepy Joe Biden on his ridiculous Climate Change Plan is a big problem but the Corrupt Media will save him. His other problem is that he is drawing flies not people to his Rallies. Nobody is showing up I mean nobody. You can’t win without people!
....FISA abuse Christopher Steele & his phony and corrupt Dossier the Clinton Foundation illegal surveillance of Trump Campaign Russian collusion by Dems - and so much more. Open up the papers & documents without redaction? Come on Jeff you can do it the country is waiting!
Senate passed the VA Accountability Act. The House should get this bill to my desk ASAP! We can’t tolerate substandard care for our vets.
Why didn’t John Bolton complain about this "nonsense" a long time ago when he was very publicly terminated. He said not that it matters NOTHING!
....must stay strong and fight back with vigor. Stop working soooo hard on being politically correct which will only bring you down and continue to fight for our Country. The losers all want what you have don’t give it to them. Be strong & prosper be weak & die! Stay true....
It is a "miracle" how fast the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police were able to find the demented shooter and stop him from even more killing!
95% of Americans will pay less or at worst the same amount of taxes (mostly far less). The Dems only want to raise your taxes!
Our relationship with Russia has NEVER been worse thanks to many years of U.S. foolishness and stupidity and now the Rigged Witch Hunt!
Why aren't the same standards placed on the Democrats. Look what Hillary Clinton may have gotten away with. Disgraceful!
Thanks to Leader McConnell for agreeing to bring a Senate vote on Criminal Justice this week! These historic changes will make communities SAFER and SAVE tremendous taxpayers dollars. It brings much needed hope to many families during the Holiday Season.
The Democrats would not have BANNED travel from heavily infected China especially so early therefore far more people would have died. Corrupt Joe Biden now admits this!!!
....say he fought back against this phony crime that didn’t exist this horrendous false accusation and he shouldn’t fight back he should just sit back and take it. Could this be Obstruction? No Mueller didn’t find Obstruction either. Presidential Harassment!
Storm turned Hurricane is getting much bigger and more powerful than projected. Federal Government is on site and ready to respond. Be safe!
Prominent legal scholars agree that our actions to address the National Emergency at the Southern Border and to protect the American people are both CONSTITUTIONAL and EXPRESSLY authorized by Congress....
It is outrageous that Poisonous Synthetic Heroin Fentanyl comes pouring into the U.S. Postal System from China. We can and must END THIS NOW! The Senate should pass the STOP ACT – and firmly STOP this poison from killing our children and destroying our country. No more delay!
Pocahontas just stated that the Democrats lead by the legendary Crooked Hillary Clinton rigged the Primaries! Lets go FBI & Justice Dept.
Watch Mark Levin on air now. Great! @FoxNews
We must protect our country and our workers. Our steel industry is in bad shape. IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY!
When you hear the Fake News talking negatively about my meeting with President Putin and all that I gave up remember I gave up NOTHING we merely talked about future benefits for both countries. Also we got along very well which is a good thing except for the Corrupt Media!
Another big Caravan heading our way. Very hard to stop without a Wall!
.....Now if you really want to fix the Crisis at the Southern Border both humanitarian and otherwise tell migrants not to come into our country unless they are willing to do so legally and hopefully through a system based on Merit. This way we have no problems at all!
I look forward to working w/ D's + R's in Congress to address immigration reform in a way that puts hardworking citizens of our country 1st.
Just out: The Obama Administration knew far in advance of November 8th about election meddling by Russia. Did nothing about it. WHY?
After many years of LEAKS going on in Washington it is great to see the A.G. taking action! For National Security the tougher the better!
Terrence K. Williams "You can’t impeach Trump for being a winner!"
Now that they realize the only Collusion with Russia was done by Crooked Hillary Clinton & the Democrats Nadler Schiff and the Dem heads of the Committees have gone stone cold CRAZY. 81 letter sent to innocent people to harass them. They won’t get ANYTHING done for our Country!
Biden and the Democrats have greatly disrespected the Great State of Wisconsin by not even paying a small visit to Milwaukee the designated site of the DNC. The State & City worked very hard to make sure things would be good. Not nice. Vote Trump Wisconsin!
Thank you for the good reviews and comments on my interview with Chris Wallace of @FoxNews. We may have set a record for doing such an interview in the heat. It was 100 degrees making things very interesting!
After many years (decades) Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border mostly from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador. They have ALL been taking U.S. money for years and doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for us just like the Democrats in Congress!
I see it each time I go out to Rallies in order to help some of our great Republican candidates. VOTERS ARE REALLY ANGRY AT THE VICIOUS AND DESPICABLE WAY DEMOCRATS ARE TREATING BRETT KAVANAUGH! He and his wonderful family deserve much better.
"Concast" should open up a long overdue Florida Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough. I know him and Crazy Mika well used them beautifully in the last Election dumped them nicely and will state on the record that he is "nuts". Besides bad ratings! #OPENJOECOLDCASE
Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country. It is a disgrace. We are the only Country in the World so naive! WALL
DRAIN THE SWAMP!
Back from Japan after a very successful trip. Big progress on MANY fronts. A great country with a wonderful leader in Prime Minister Abe!
....misrepresenting what took place inside of the hospital. Their news conference after I left for El Paso was a fraud. It bore no resemblance to what took place with those incredible people that I was so lucky to meet and spend time with. They were all amazing!o
.@60Minutes did a phony story about child separation when they know we had the exact same policy as the Obama Administration. In fact a picture of children in jails was used by other Fake Media to show how bad (cruel) we are but it was in 2014 during O years. Obama separated....
Heading to the Southern Border to show a section of the new Wall being built! Leaving now!
Congratulations to Mexico and Canada!
The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough but this was not the language used. What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA!
We are making great progress with healthcare. ObamaCare is imploding and will only get worse. Republicans coming together to get job done!
THE GREATEST SCAM IN THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN POLITICS!
No Collusion No Obstruction - there has NEVER been a President who has been more transparent. Millions of pages of documents were given to the Mueller Angry Dems plus I allowed everyone to testify including W.H. counsel. I didn’t have to do this but now they want more.....
With Mexico being one of the highest crime Nations in the world we must have THE WALL. Mexico will pay for it through reimbursement/other.
I am meeting with the major pharmaceutical companies today at the White House about progress on a vaccine and cure. Progress being made!
WITCH HUNT!
The U.S. together with Mexico and Canada just got the World Cup. Congratulations - a great deal of hard work!
....Where is the DNC Server and why didn’t the FBI take possession of it? Deep State?
State of Nevada "thinks" that they can send out illegal vote by mail ballots creating a great Voter Fraud scenario for the State and the U.S. They can’t! If they do "I think" I can hold up funds to the State. Sorry but you must not cheat in elections. @RussVought45 @USTreasury
Failing  Michigan Governor must work harder and be much more proactive. We are pushing her to get the job done. I stand with Michigan!
Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office. Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill.
Why would Suburban Women vote for Biden and the Democrats when Democrat run cities are now rampant with crime (and they aren’t asking the Federal Government for help) which could easily spread to the suburbs and they will reconstitute on steroids their low income suburbs plan!
Nellie Ohr the wife of DOJ official Bruce Ohr was long ago investigating for pay (GPS Fusion) members of my family feeding it to her husband who was then giving it to the FBI even though it was created by ousted & discredited Christopher Steele. Illegal! WITCH HUNT
Billions of dollars are and will be coming into United States coffers because of Tariffs. Great also for negotiations - if a country won’t give us a fair Trade Deal we will institute Tariffs on them. Used or not jobs and businesses will be created. U.S. respected again!
It always happens! When a Conservative does even a fraction of what Chris Cuomo did with his lunatic ranting raving & cursing they get destroyed by the Fake News. But when a Liberal Democrat like Chris Cuomo does it Republicans immediately come to his defense. We never learn!
I hope the grandstanding Governor of California is able to spend his very highly taxed citizens money on asylum holds more efficiently than money has been spent on the so-called Fast Train which is $Billions over budget & in total disarray. Time to reduce taxes in California!
...are now fighting back like never before. There is so much GUILT by Democrats/Clinton and now the facts are pouring out. DO SOMETHING!
...and have no intention of doing anything other than going on a fishing expedition to see if they can find anything on me - both illegal & unprecedented in U.S. history. There was no Collusion - Investigate the Investigators! Go to work on Drug Price Reductions & Infrastructure!
Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere just wasting his money but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie something they wouldn’t do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again 2016.
The last thing we need in Alabama and the U.S. Senate is a Schumer/Pelosi puppet who is WEAK on Crime WEAK on the Border Bad for our Military and our great Vets Bad for our 2nd Amendment AND WANTS TO RAISES TAXES TO THE SKY. Jones would be a disaster!
Thank you for the great reviews of the @ABC News show last night!
Remember this Andrew McCabe didn’t go to the bathroom without the approval of Leakin’ James Comey!
It is now commonly agreed after many months of COSTLY looking that there was NO collusion between Russia and Trump. Was collusion with HC!
Looking forward to being in Allentown Pennsylvania on Thursday. I love the State and for very good reason!
Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past. I have many (too many!) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices and even homes are going to be raided with everything including their phones and computers taken. All lawyers are deflated and concerned!
Just remember the Iranians never won a war but never lost a negotiation!
Sleepyeyes Chuck Todd of Meet the Corrupt Press just had a "totally" softball interview with conman Adam Schiff never even calling Shifty out on his fraudulent statement to Congress where he made up ALL of the words of my conversation with the Ukrainian President! FAKE NEWS
Baltimore under the leadership of Elijah Cummings has the worst Crime Statistics in the Nation. 25 years of all talk no action! So tired of listening to the same old Bull...Next Reverend Al will show up to complain & protest. Nothing will get done for the people in need. Sad!
.@foxandfriends trounces Morning Psycho (MSDNC) in the Ratings!
Congratulations Stephen Miller- on representing me this morning on the various Sunday morning shows. Great job!
Charles Koch of Koch Brothers who claims to be giving away millions of dollars to politicians even though I know very few who have seen this (?) now makes the ridiculous statement that what President Trump is doing is unfair to "foreign workers." He is correct AMERICA FIRST!
...We have already had ticket requests in excess of 200000 people. I look forward to seeing everyone in Oklahoma!
New Economic Records being set on a daily basis - and it is not by accident!
23% of Federal inmates are illegal immigrants. Border arrests are up 240%. In the Great State of Texas between 2011 & 2018 there were a total of 292000 crimes by illegal aliens 539 murders 32000 assaults 3426 sexual assaults and 3000 weapons charges. Democrats come back!
"Now that the Dems are going to try & switch from Collusion to some other reason it makes them continue to look like sore losers who didn’t accept the WILL OF THE PEOPLE in the last election - they will do anything to get rid of the President." @AriFleischer It will never work!
Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side not mine!
....This was a real compromise in order to give another big victory to our Great Military and Vets!
Just spoke with Jacinda Ardern the Prime Minister of New Zealand regarding the horrific events that have taken place over the past 24 hours. I informed the Prime Minister....
"The FBI looked at less than 1%" of Crooked’s Emails!
I told Rex Tillerson our wonderful Secretary of State that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man...
"In the House the President got less due process than the 9-11 terrorists got. This is a corrupt process?" Mark Levin @marklevinshow "Very much so!" @RepDougCollins @FoxNews
So sorry to hear about the terrible accident involving our GREAT West Point Cadets. We mourn the loss of life and pray for the injured. God Bless them ALL!
The first so-called second hand information "Whistleblower" got my phone conversation almost completely wrong so now word is they are going to the bench and another "Whistleblower" is coming in from the Deep State also with second hand info. Meet with Shifty. Keep them coming!
Most politicians would have gone to a meeting like the one Don jr attended in order to get info on an opponent. That's politics!
Google is helping China and their military but not the U.S. Terrible! The good news is that they helped Crooked Hillary Clinton and not Trump....and how did that turn out?
Former Senator Harry Reid (he got thrown out) is working hard to put a good spin on his failed career. He led through lies and deception only to be replaced by another beauty Cryin’ Chuck Schumer. Some things just never change!
California finally deserves a great Governor one who understands borders crime and lowering taxes. John Cox is the man - he’ll be the best Governor you’ve ever had. I fully endorse John Cox for Governor and look forward to working with him to Make California Great Again!
Dems are trying to steal the Mike Garcia Congressional Race in California. Republicans get out and VOTE for your terrific candidate ASAP!
I cannot imagine that Congress would dare to leave Washington without a beautiful new HealthCare bill fully approved and ready to go!
Congratulations to Ron DeSantis on becoming the new Governor of Florida. Against all odds he fought & fought & fought the result being a historic victory. He never gave up and never will. He will be a great Governor!
Immediately after Comey’s firing Peter Strzok texted to his lover Lisa Page "We need to Open the case we’ve been waiting on now while Andy (McCabe also fired) is acting. Page answered "We need to lock in (redacted). In a formal chargeable way. Soon." Wow a conspiracy caught?
Funny to see Corrupt Joe Biden reading a statement on Russia which was obviously written by his handlers. Russia ate his and Obama’s lunch during their time in office so badly that Obama wanted them out of the then G-8. U.S. was weak on everything but especially Russia!
I informed John Bolton last night that his services are no longer needed at the White House. I disagreed strongly with many of his suggestions as did others in the Administration and therefore....
I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty. I hardly even knew this guy. Just another of his many lies. His "memos" are self serving and FAKE!
The only people that don’t like my conversation with the new Ukrainian President are those that heard Rep. Adam Schiff read a made up and totally fraudulent statement to the House and public words that I did not say but that he fabricated (& admitted to this fabrication). Sick!
James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION. Also he leaked classified information. WOW! Will the Witch Hunt continue?
Received many calls from leaders of NATO countries thanking me for helping to bring them together and to get them focused on financial obligations both present & future. We had a truly great Summit that was inaccurately covered by much of the media. NATO is now strong & rich!
The deep state or whoever over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. Obviously they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed and saving lives! @SteveFDA
The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun. I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something and especially since this is for the American People!
The Fake News Media is going CRAZY! They are totally unhinged and in many ways after witnessing first hand the damage they do to so many innocent and decent people I enjoy watching. In 7 years when I am no longer in office their ratings will dry up and they will be gone!
New Poll - A majority of Americans think that John Brennan and James Comey should have their Security Clearances Revoked. Not surprised! @FoxNews
Wow watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked "have you ever been an anonymous source...or known someone else to be an anonymous source...?" He said strongly "never no." He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends.
Best economic numbers in decades. If the Democrats take control kiss your newfound wealth goodbye!
Arizona together with our Military and Border Patrol is bracing for a massive surge at a NON-WALLED area. WE WILL NOT LET THEM THROUGH. Big danger. Nancy and Chuck must approve Boarder Security and the Wall!
#StopTheCoup
Our Country is doing GREAT. Best financial numbers on the Planet. Great to have USA WINNING AGAIN!
"It’s time to put House Democrats on trial."  @IngrahamAngle
Gallup Poll: "Open Borders will potentially attract 42 million Latin Americans." This would be a disaster for the U.S. We need the Wall now!
"Joe Biden a little out of it let’s face it so he is the perfect vessel an empty vessel to transform the Country." @TuckerCarlson  @FoxNews "Destroying your dreams and ending your life."  Ned Ryan
So interesting that bad lawyer Michael Cohen who sadly will not be testifying before Congress is using the lawyer of Crooked Hillary Clinton to represent him - Gee how did that happen? Remember July 4th weekend when Crooked went before FBI & wasn’t sworn in no tape nothing?
My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today The Daytona 500. Brian France and the France family are special people. Enjoy the race!
The Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before. In just two hours the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats have seen their phony case absolutely shredded. Shifty is now exposed for illegally making up my phone call & more!
The story by Axios that President Trump wanted to blow up large hurricanes with nuclear weapons prior to reaching shore is ridiculous. I never said this. Just more FAKE NEWS!
Best wishes to Prime Minister @Netanyahu and all of the people of Israel on the 70th Anniversary of your Great Independence. We have no better friends anywhere. Looking forward to moving our Embassy to Jerusalem next month!
....immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions. Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this. Far more assets at much less cost than guards. A "gun free" school is a magnet for bad people. ATTACKS WOULD END!
Democrats should come back to Washington and work to end the Shutdown while at the same time ending the horrible humanitarian crisis at our Southern Border. I am in the White House waiting for you!
The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt. Many new jobs high business enthusiasm..
If Obama worked as hard on straightening out our country as he has trying to protect and elect Hillary we would all be much better off!
Great news from @Ford! They are investing nearly $1 BILLION in Flat Rock Michigan for auto production on top of a $1 BILLION investment last month in a facility outside of Chicago. Companies are pouring back into the United States - they want to be where the action is!
If last night’s election proved anything it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate.
The FBI local and state law enforcement are working together in El Paso and in Dayton Ohio. Information is rapidly being accumulated in Dayton. Much has already be learned in El Paso. Law enforcement was very rapid in both instances. Updates will be given throughout the day!
A Blue Wave means Crime and Open Borders. A Red Wave means Safety and Strength!
Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses. Too bad!
As usual with "this" General Motors things just never seem to work out. They said they were going to give us 40000 much needed Ventilators "very quickly". Now they are saying it will only be 6000 in late April and they want top dollar. Always a mess with Mary B. Invoke "P".
The Failing New York Times (it will pass away when I leave office in 6 years) and others of the Fake News Media keep writing phony stories about how I didn’t use many banks because they didn’t want to do business with me. WRONG! It is because I didn’t need money. Very old
Reviewing the funding bill with my team at the @WhiteHouse!
Many dead including women and children in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria. Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army making it completely inaccessible to outside world. President Putin Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad. Big price...
The Democrats much as I suspected have allocated no money for a new Wall. So imaginative! The problem is without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border!
Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Texas! #MAGA
The highly respected Farm Journal has just announced my Approval Rating with our great Farmers at 74% and that despite all of the Fake & Corrupt News that they are forced to endure. Farmers have been unfairly treated for many years - and that is turning around FAST!
Only 25 percent want the President Impeached which is pretty low considering the volume of Fake News coverage but pretty high considering the fact that I did NOTHING wrong. It is all just a continuation of the greatest Scam and Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!
Wow Matt Lauer was just fired from NBC for "inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace." But when will the top executives at NBC & Comcast be fired for putting out so much Fake News. Check out Andy Lack’s past!
Build your products in the United States and there are NO TARIFFS!
Wow! Just got word that our June 18th Tuesday ANNOUNCEMENT in Orlando Florida already has 74000 requests for a 20000 seat Arena. With all of the big events that we have done this ticket looks to be the "hottest" of them all. See you in Florida!
The New York Times has a new Fake Story that now the Russians and Chinese (glad they finally added China) are listening to all of my calls on cellphones. Except that I rarely use a cellphone & when I do it’s government authorized. I like Hard Lines. Just more made up Fake News!
Why was the FBI giving so much information to the Fake News Media. They are not supposed to be doing that and knowing the enemy of the people Fake News they put their own spin on it - truth doesn’t matter to them!
The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem. Total disrespect for our great country!
Congratulations to wonderful Charles Payne on having been so optimistic and therefore correct. Market up BIG!!!
When will Bill Nelson concede in Florida? The characters running Broward and Palm Beach voting will not be able to "find" enough votes too much spotlight on them now!
I am very disappointed in China. Our foolish past leaders have allowed them to make hundreds of billions of dollars a year in trade yet...
Thanks to very brave Teacher & Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville Indiana for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives. His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world!
Why are Democrats fighting massive tax cuts for the middle class and business (jobs)? The reason: Obstruction and Delay!
"Prosperity is returning. Donald Trump is doing exactly what he said he would do as a candidate now as the most effective president the most successful president in modern American history." Thank you to the great Lou Dobbs!
The wonderful Diamond and Silk have been treated so horribly by Facebook. They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad - and we’re looking into. It’s getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!
The Democrats don’t want a Witness Trade because Shifty Schiff the Biden’s the fake Whistleblower(& his lawyer) the second Whistleblower (who vanished after I released the Transcripts) the so-called "informer" & many other Democrat disasters would be a BIG problem for them!
Wow @CNN RATINGS HAVE CRASHED. LOST ALL CREDIBILITY!
Wow a blowout JOBS number just out adjusted for revisions and the General Motors strike 303000. This is far greater than expectations. USA ROCKS!
Judge Gorsuch will be sworn in at the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday at 11:00 A.M. He will be a great Justice. Very proud of him!
Good news House just passed #KatesLaw. Hopefully Senate will follow.
I meet and talk to "foreign governments" every day. I just met with the Queen of England (U.K.) the Prince of Wales the P.M. of the United Kingdom the P.M. of Ireland the President of France and the President of Poland. We talked about "Everything!" Should I immediately....
Just heard that Wacko John Bolton was talking of the fact that I discussed "love letters from Kim Jong Un" as though I viewed them as just that. Obviously was just being sarcastic. Bolton was such a jerk!
Nancy I am still thinking about the State of the Union speech there are so many options - including doing it as per your written offer (made during the Shutdown security is no problem) and my written acceptance. While a contract is a contract I’ll get back to you soon!
The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing else’s that will work and that has been true for thousands of years. It’s like the wheel there is nothing better. I know tech better than anyone & technology.....
There was NO DEAL made with Turkey for the release and return of Pastor Andrew Brunson. I don’t make deals for hostages. There was however great appreciation on behalf of the United States which will lead to good perhaps great relations between the United States & Turkey!
The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like how come he gave up Classified Information (jail) why did he lie to Congress (jail) why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it) why the phony memos McCabe’s $700000 & more?
We have made more progress in the last nine months against ISIS than the Obama Administration has made in 8 years.Must be proactive & nasty!
I am continuing to get rid of costly and unnecessary regulations. Much work left to do but effect will be great! Business & jobs will grow.
I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book! I never spoke to him for book. Full of lies misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist. Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve!
Thank you to Fred Smith and @FedEx for the rapid emergency deliveries you are making all over our Nation. Keep it going!
Sending out 80 MILLION BALLOTS to people who aren’t even asking for a Ballot is unfair and a total fraud in the making. Look at what’s going on right now!
With so much talk about the Wall people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol ICE and our great Military. Remember the Caravans? Well they didn’t get through and none are forming or on their way. Border is tight. Fake News silent!
Deal with Mexico is coming along nicely. Autoworkers and farmers must be taken care of or there will be no deal. New President of Mexico has been an absolute gentleman. Canada must wait. Their Tariffs and Trade Barriers are far too high. Will tax cars if we can’t make a deal!
China and the United States are working well together on trade but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China for so many years that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries. But be cool it will all work out!
Rep. Adam Schiff fraudulently read to Congress with millions of people watching a version of my conversation with the President of Ukraine that doesn’t exist. He was supposedly reading the exact transcribed version of the call but he completely changed the words to make it...
Our incredible U.S. Coast Guard saved more than 15000 lives last week with Harvey. Irma could be even tougher. We love our Coast Guard!
....The United States looses soooo much money on Trade with Mexico under NAFTA over 75 Billion Dollars a year (not including Drug Money which would be many times that amount) that I would consider closing the Southern Border a "profit making operation." We build a Wall or.....
The Democrats in Congress yesterday were vicious and totally showed their cards for everyone to see. When the Republicans had the Majority they never acted with such hatred and scorn! The Dems are trying to win an election in 2020 that they know they cannot legitimately win!
College educated women want safety security and healthcare protections – very much along with financial and economic health for themselves and our Country. I supply all of this far better than any Democrat (for decades actually). That’s why they will be voting for me!
....which it was not (but even if it was it is only a CIVIL CASE like Obama’s - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer’s liability if he made a mistake not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced. WITCH HUNT!
Keep hearing about "tiny" amount of money spent on Facebook ads. What about the billions of dollars of Fake News on CNN ABC NBC & CBS?
Brian Kemp is running for Governor of the great state of Georgia. The Primary is on Tuesday. Brian is tough on crime strong on the border and illegal immigration. He loves our Military and our Vets and protects our Second Amendment. I give him my full and total endorsement.
At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up. The American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country our Flag and our National Anthem. Weak and out of control!
Just checked out the new Wall on the Border - GREAT! Leaving now for L.A.
Spoke to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe of Sri Lanka this morning to inform him that the United States stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism. Also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the People of the United States!
I had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 Billion more and will pay hundreds of Billions of Dollars more in the future only because of me. NATO was weak but now it is strong again (bad for Russia). The media only says I was rude to leaders never mentions the money!
Senator John Cornyn has done an outstanding job for the people of Texas. He is strong on Crime the Border the Second Amendment and loves our Military and Vets. John has my complete and total endorsement. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
China posts slowest economic numbers since 1990 due to U.S. trade tensions and new policies. Makes so much sense for China to finally do a Real Deal and stop playing around!
Read the Transcripts! Also see where I say "us" (our Country) as opposed to "me" (meaning me) and where I then say that the Attorney General (of the United States) will call you. People still remember Schiff’s made up and fraudulent version of my conversation. Witch Hunt!
While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA!
Presidential Harassment by "crazed" Democrats at the highest level in the history of our Country. Likewise the most vicious and corrupt Mainstream Media that any president has ever had to endure - Yet the most successful first two years for any
....at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.
On Air Force One heading to Wisconsin. Biden refused to go there to apologize for not showing up for the failed Democrat Convention. So funny to watch the Fake News fawning over Sleepy Joe’s ridiculous "car press conference". Pathetic!
Congratulations to Prime Minister Abe of Japan for hosting such a fantastic and well run G-20. There wasn’t a thing that was missing or a mistake that was made. PERFECT! The people of Japan must be very proud of their Prime Minister.
After 1 year of investigation with Zero evidence being found Chuck Schumer just stated that "Democrats should blame ourselvesnot Russia."
Does anybody really believe that Roger Stone a man whose house was raided early in the morning by 29 gun toting FBI Agents (with Fake News @CNN closely in toe) was treated fairly. How about the jury forewoman with her unannounced hatred & bias. Same scammers as General Flynn!
Was just presented the concept and parameters of the Border Security Deal by hard working Senator Richard Shelby. Looking over all aspects knowing that this will be hooked up with lots of money from other sources....
Mini Mike. No I would rather run against you!
Badly failing presidential candidate @KamalaHarris will not go to a very wonderful largely African American event today because yesterday I recieved a major award at the same event for being able to produce & sign into law major Criminal Justice Reform legislation which will..
Will be having a News Conference from our beautiful White House at 5:00 P.M. Many things to discuss. Thank you!
The President of Ukraine said that he was NOT pressured by me to do anything wrong. Can’t have better testimony than that! As V.P. Biden had his son on the other hand take out millions of dollars by strong arming the Ukrainian President. Also looted millions from China. Bad!
FBI top lawyer confirms "unusual steps." They relied on the Clinton Campaign’s Fake & Unverified "Dossier" which is illegal. "That has corrupted them. That has enabled them to gather evidence by UNCONSTITUTIONAL MEANS and that’s what they did to the President." Judge Napolitano
The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security. The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military at a time we need it more than ever. We need a merit based system of immigration and we need it now! No more dangerous Lottery.
I will be having a White House Press Conference today at 5:45 P.M. Thank you!
Congress should come back to D.C. now and FIX THE IMMIGRATION LAWS!
It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives. Be nice you will do much better!
There are a lot of CRIMINALS in the Caravan. We will stop them. Catch and Detain! Judicial Activism by people who know nothing about security and the safety of our citizens is putting our country in great danger. Not good!
....At what point does this soon to be $20000000 Witch Hunt composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years STOP! They have found no Collussion with Russia No Obstruction but they aren’t looking at the corruption...
"There has been no evidence whatsoever that Donald Trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the 2016 election. In fact the evidence is the opposite that Hillary Clinton & the Democrats colluded with the Russians to fix the 2016 election." @GrahamLedger
Not seen in many years America’s steelworkers get a hard-earned raise because of my Administration’s policies to help bring back the U.S. steel industry which is critical to our National Security. I will always protect America and its workers!
Getting ready to land in Japan with First Lady Melania. We look forward to seeing everyone soon!🇺🇸🇯🇵
I am fighting the Fake (Corrupt) News the Deep State the Democrats and the few remaining Republicans In Name Only (RINOS who are on mouth to mouth resuscitation) with the help of some truly great Republicans and others. We are Winning big (150th Federal Judge this week)!
Congratulations to Tucker Carlson on the great success of his book "Ship of Fools." It just went to NUMBER ONE!
Bob Mueller (who is a much different man than people think) and his out of control band of Angry Democrats don’t want the truth they only want lies. The truth is very bad for their mission!
Big spike in the China Plague in Europe and other places that the Fake News used to hold up as examples of places that are doing well in order to make the U.S look bad. Be strong and vigilant it will run its course. Vaccines and cures are coming fast!
I know better than anyone that my friend Roger Ailes died 3 years ago just look at what happened to @FoxNews. We all miss Roger!!!
"The only way to shut down the Democrats new Mob Rule strategy is to stop them cold at the Ballot Box. The fight for America’s future is never over!" Ben Shapiro
The hatred and extreme bias of me by @CNN has clouded their thinking and made them unable to function. But actually as I have always said this has been going on for a long time. Little Jeff Z has done a terrible job his ratings suck & AT&T should fire him to save credibility!
When I decided to go to Ohio for Troy Balderson he was down in early voting 64 to 36. That was not good. After my speech on Saturday night there was a big turn for the better. Now Troy wins a great victory during a very tough time of the year for voting. He will win BIG in Nov.
....Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost or damage incurred at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning it is a Threat. Happy New Year!
Adam Schiff should only be so lucky to have the brains honor and strength of Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. For a lowlife like Schiff who completely fabricated my words and read them to Congress as though they were said by me to demean a First in Class at West Point is SAD!
Great total numbers for the Republican National Convention. Blows Democrat National Convention away. Also much bigger fund raising numbers!
Here we go with the Fake Polls. Just like what happened with the Election against Crooked Hillary Clinton. ABC NBC CNN @nytimes @washingtonpost they all got it wrong on purpose. Suppression Polls so early? They will never learn!
It was a very bad week for the Democrats with the GREAT economic numbers The Virginia disaster and the State of the Union address. Now with the terrible offers being made by them to the Border Committee I actually believe they want a Shutdown. They want a new subject!
Just spoke to Governor Jerry Brown to let him know that we are with him and the people of California all the way!
Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding. Many lives can be saved. Came out of meeting. Good!
The Stock Market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only Record Setting Stock Prices but present and future Jobs Jobs Jobs. Seven TRILLION dollars of value created since our big election win!
I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time & as I have often said getting along with Russia is a good thing not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!
Congressman Ron DeSantis a top student at Yale and Harvard Law School is running for Governor of the Great State of Florida. Ron is strong on Borders tough on Crime & big on Cutting Taxes - Loves our Military & our Vets. He will be a Great Governor & has my full Endorsement!
When I said in my phone call to the President of Ukraine "I would like you to do US a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it." With the word "us" I am referring to the United States our Country. I then went on to say that......
Countries that have treated us unfairly on trade for years are all coming to Washington to negotiate. This should have taken place many years ago butas the saying goes better late than never!
"There’s only been 5 times in the last 105 years that an incumbent President has won seats in the Senate in the off year election. Mr. Trump has magic about him. This guy has magic coming out of his ears. He is an astonishing vote getter & campaigner. The Republicans are.........
If Democrats were not such obstructionists and understood the power of lower taxes we would be able to get many of their ideas into Bill!
I will be going to Texas and Louisiana tomorrow with First Lady. Great progress being made! Spending weekend working at White House.
"No President in modern times has kept more promises than Donald Trump!" Thank you Bill Bennett @SteveHiltonx
....The Democrats none of whom voted for Jeff Sessions must love him now. Same thing with Lyin’ James Comey. The Dems all hated him wanted him out thought he was disgusting - UNTIL I FIRED HIM! Immediately he became a wonderful man a saint like figure in fact. Really sick!
So wonderful to be in Las Vegas yesterday and meet with people from police to doctors to the victims themselves who I will never forget!
The four hospitals that we (FEMA) are building in NYC at the Javits Convention Center are moving along very well ahead of schedule. Many additional ventilators also delivered. Good conversation with Governor Cuomo!
The Dow just broke 24000 for the first time (another all-time Record). If the Dems had won the Presidential Election the Market would be down 50% from these levels and Consumer Confidence which is also at an all-time high would be "low and glum!"
Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL. It will get built and help stop drugs human trafficking etc.
"Our economy right now is the Gold Standard throughout the World." @IngrahamAngle  So true and not even close!
....The only problem is that they know I am going to win (best economy & employment numbers in U.S. history & much more) and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!
What an INCREDIBLE opening by @JesseBWatters. I will put it up later for everyone to see!
With all that this Administration has accomplished think what my Poll Numbers would be if we had an honest Media which we do not!
Democrats at the top are killing the Great State of Virginia. If the three failing pols were Republicans far stronger action would be taken. Virginia will come back HOME Republican) in 2020!
A Poll in today’s New York Post says that 77% of "U.S. adults have confidence in their government’s ability to handle the Coronavirus (Number One) compared to other health threats." 64% for Zika 58% for Ebola. Others way down on list. Our professionals are doing a great job!
Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling. Just hit 50% which is higher than Cheatin’ Obama at the same time in his Administration.
NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION!
Stock Market just hit another record high! Jobs looking very good.
The European Union makes it impossible for our farmers and workers and companies to do business in Europe (U.S. has a $151 Billion trade deficit) and then they want us to happily defend them through NATO and nicely pay for it. Just doesn’t work!
Great Rally In Colorado. Thank you will be back soon!
Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof). Sad!
Such a "puff piece" on Nancy Pelosi by @60minutes yet her leadership has passed no meaningful Legislation. All they do is Investigate as it turns out crimes that they instigated & committed. The Mueller No Collusion decision wasn’t even discussed-and she was a disaster at W.H.
Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico & Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era and other laws NOW! The Democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked....CRIME! We will be taking strong action today.
....in the world. I want clean air and clean water and have been making great strides in improving America’s environment. But American taxpayers – and American workers – shouldn’t pay to clean up others countries’ pollution.
Since Congress can't get its act together on HealthCare I will be using the power of the pen to give great HealthCare to many people - FAST
.@FoxNews-FBI’s Andrew McCabe "in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet) he was using allegedly his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton."
Michael Cohen plead guilty to two counts of campaign finance violations that are not a crime. President Obama had a big campaign finance violation and it was easily settled!
The European Union wonderful countries who treat the U.S. very badly on trade are complaining about the tariffs on Steel & Aluminum. If they drop their horrific barriers & tariffs on U.S. products going in we will likewise drop ours. Big Deficit. If not we Tax Cars etc. FAIR!
Did you ever see an investigation more in search of a crime? At the same time Mueller and the Angry Democrats aren’t even looking at the atrocious and perhaps subversive crimes that were committed by Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. A total disgrace!
Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson. His trials and tribulations were great his life complex and controversial. Others have looked at this over the years most thought it would be done but yes I am considering a Full Pardon!
.@FoxNews is out with another of their phony polls done by the same group of haters that got it even more wrong in 2016. Watch what happens in November. Fox is terrible!
Just landed in Michigan. Car companies and many others are building and expanding here. Great to see!
Will be having a Press Conference at 5:45 P.M. See you in 15 minutes!
I believe that if people stoped using or subscribing to @ATT they would be forced to make big changes at @CNN which is dying in the ratings anyway. It is so unfair with such bad Fake News! Why wouldn’t they act. When the World watches @CNN it gets a false picture of USA. Sad!
I have just officially nominated Poland for entry into the Visa Waiver Program. With this decades long-awaited announcement we are in the final steps of the process which when complete would grant Polish nationals visa-free business and tourism travel to the U.S. & vice versa.
The Democrats must end the loopholes on immigration. So easy to solve!
"I will never testify against Trump." This statement was recently made by Roger Stone essentially stating that he will not be forced by a rogue and out of control prosecutor to make up lies and stories about "President Trump." Nice to know that some people still have "guts!"
....In addition I want to meet not only my accuser who presented SECOND & THIRD HAND INFORMATION but also the person who illegally gave this information which was largely incorrect to the "Whistleblower." Was this person SPYING on the U.S. President? Big Consequences!
Beto O’Rourke is a total lightweight compared to Ted Cruz and he comes nowhere near representing the values and desires of the people of the Great State of Texas. He will never be allowed to turn Texas into Venezuela!
....Iran’s very ignorant and insulting statement put out today only shows that they do not understand reality. Any attack by Iran on anything American will be met with great and overwhelming force. In some areas overwhelming will mean obliteration. No more John Kerry & Obama!
Thank you to @exxonmobil for your $20 billion investment that is creating more than 45000 manufacturing & construction jobs in the USA!
CHINA HAS ALREADY BEGUN AGRICULTURAL PURCHASES FROM OUR GREAT PATRIOT FARMERS & RANCHERS!
Big week coming up!
The W.H. is functioning perfectly focused on HealthCare Tax Cuts/Reform & many other things. I have very little time for watching T.V.
At the request of many I will be reviewing the case of a "U.S. Military hero" Major Matt Golsteyn who is charged with murder. He could face the death penalty from our own government after he admitted to killing a Terrorist bomb maker while overseas. @PeteHegseth @FoxNews
....It has now been determined that the Mueller Scam should never have been set up in the first place there were no grounds. It was all an illegitimate Witch Hunt & a big price must be paid. How different my life would have been if this fraud on America was never committed!!!
Juan Williams at @FoxNews is so pathetic and yet when he met me in the Fox Building lobby he couldn’t have been nicer as he asked me to take a picture of him and me for his family. Yet he is always nasty and wrong!
Just landed. India was great trip very successful. Heading to the White House. Meetings and calls scheduled today. @CDCgov @SecAzar and all doing a great job with respect to Coronavirus! Briefing this afternoon.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis just signed Bill banning Sanctuary Cities in State & forcing all law enforcement agencies to cooperate with Federal Immigration authorities. Bill prohibits local Gov’t from enacting Sanctuary policies that protect undocumented immigrants...@FoxNews
Iger where is my call of apology? You and ABC have offended millions of people and they demand a response. How is Brian Ross doing? He tanked the market with an ABC lie yet no apology. Double Standard!
With all of the Fake News coming out of NBC and the Networks at what point is it appropriate to challenge their License? Bad for country!
The big Caravan of People from Honduras now coming across Mexico and heading to our "Weak Laws" Border had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!
The Democrats will probably submit a Bill being cute as always which gives everything away but gives NOTHING to Border Security namely the Wall. You see without the Wall there can be no Border Security - the Tech "stuff" is just by comparison meaningless bells & whistles...
The Democrats do not want to help DACA. Would be so easy to make a deal!
Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization. Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal. She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first!
Our great Republican Congressman John Ratcliffe is being treated very unfairly by the LameStream Media. Rather than going through months of slander and libel I explained to John how miserable it would be for him and his family to deal with these people....
Best Jobs Numbers in the history of our great Country! Many other things likewise. So why wouldn’t we win the Midterms? Dems can never do even nearly as well! Think of what will happen to your now beautiful 401-k’s!
Big 4th of July in D.C. "Salute to America." The Pentagon & our great Military Leaders are thrilled to be doing this & showing to the American people among other things the strongest and most advanced Military anywhere in the World. Incredible Flyovers & biggest ever Fireworks!
Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends this morning at 8:00 A.M. Enjoy!
"Don’t throw the American story into the river don’t throw it into the lake. Be proud of it." @kilmeade @foxandfriends
Big day of negotiations with China. They want to make a deal but do I? I meet with the Vice Premier tomorrow at The White House.
Wow. Won’t let Poll Watchers & Security into Philadelphia Voting Places. There is only one reason why. Corruption!!! Must have a fair Election.
...realize the economy is the best it’s ever been with employment being at an all time high and many companies pouring back into our country. Wake up Punchy!
17 years since September 11th!
Our relationship with Mexico is getting closer by the hour. Some really good people within both the new and old government and all working closely together....A big Trade Agreement with Mexico could be happening soon!
Congratulations to President Lopez Obrador — Mexico voted to ratify the USMCA today by a huge margin. Time for Congress to do the same here!
#JobsNotMobs!
His lies were made in perhaps the most blatant and sinister manner ever seen in the great Chamber. He wrote down and read terrible things then said it was from the mouth of the President of the United States. I want Schiff questioned at the highest level for Fraud & Treason.....
The Washington Post is constantly quoting "anonymous sources" that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a disgrace to journalism but then again so are many others!
.@NFL: Too much talk not enough action. Stand for the National Anthem.
U.S.A. Jobs numbers are the BEST in 44 years. If my opponent (the Democrats) had won the election they would have raised taxes substantially and increased regulations - the economy and jobs would have been a disaster!
As the Shutdown was going on Nancy Pelosi asked me to give the State of the Union Address. I agreed. She then changed her mind because of the Shutdown suggesting a later date. This is her prerogative - I will do the Address when the Shutdown is over. I am not looking for an....
Impossible to believe that @FoxNews has hired @donnabrazile the person fired by @CNN (after they tried to hide the bad facts & failed) for giving Crooked Hillary Clinton the questions to a debate something unimaginable. Now she is all over Fox including Shep Smith by far....
The New York Times is now blaming an editor for the horrible mistake they made in trying to destroy or influence Justice Brett Kavanaugh. It wasn’t the editor the Times knew everything. They are sick and desperate losing in so many ways!
...Mexico’s attitude is that people from other countries including Mexico should have the right to flow into the U.S. & that U.S. taxpayers should be responsible for the tremendous costs associated w/this illegal migration. Mexico is wrong and I will soon be giving a response!
Earlier today I spoke with @GovMattBevin of Kentucky regarding yesterday’s shooting at Marshall County High School. My thoughts and prayers are with Bailey Holt Preston Cope their families and all of the wounded victims who are in recovery. We are with you!
Pandering Mini Mike Bloomberg along with his wacky friend Tom Steyer have found out the hard way that you can’t buy the election! They both wish they had it to do over again!
As to the U.N. things will be different after Jan. 20th.
I will be going to Green Bay Wisconsin for a really big Rally on Saturday Evening. Big crowd expected much to talk about. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
I told you so! The European Union just slapped a Five Billion Dollar fine on one of our great companies Google. They truly have taken advantage of the U.S. but not for long!
Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the Wall through the new USMCA the replacement for NAFTA! Far more money coming to the U.S. Because of the tremendous dangers at the Border including large scale criminal and drug inflow the United States Military will build the Wall!
Sleepy Joe Biden just admitted he worked with segregationists and separately has already been very plain about the fact that he will be substantially raising everyone’s taxes if he becomes president. Ridiculously all Democrats want to substantially raise taxes!
....If however the city or state in question is willing to acknowledge responsibility and politely asks for help from the Federal Government we will very seriously consider getting involved in order to make those poorly run Democrat Cities Great Again!
Congratulations and thank you to our great Vice President & all of the many professionals doing such a fine job at CDC & all other agencies on the Coronavirus situation. Only a very small number in U.S. & China numbers look to be going down. All countries working well together!
To those few Senators who think I don’t like or appreciate being allied with other countries they are wrong I DO. What I don’t like however is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States both in Military Protection and Trade...
The illegal Mueller Witch Hunt continues in search of a crime. There was never Collusion with Russia except by the Clinton campaign so the 17 Angry Democrats are looking at anything they can find. Very unfair and BAD for the country. ALSO not allowed under the LAW!
So Crazy Nancy Pelosi said horrible things about Dr. Deborah Birx going after her because she was too positive on the very good job we are doing on combatting the China Virus including Vaccines & Therapeutics. In order to counter Nancy Deborah took the bait & hit us. Pathetic!
We have agreed to a very large Phase One Deal with China. They have agreed to many structural changes and massive purchases of Agricultural Product Energy and Manufactured Goods plus much more. The 25% Tariffs will remain as is with 7 1/2% put on much of the remainder....
Why isn’t the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and non-monetary Trade Barriers against the U.S. Totally unfair to our farmers workers & companies. Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!
For all of the Fake News Sunday Political Shows whose bias & dishonesty is greater than ever seen in our Country before please inform your viewers that our Economy is setting records with more people employed today than at any time in U.S. history our Military which....
We are doing great Economically as a Country Number One despite the Fed’s antiquated policy on rates and tightening. Much room to grow!
Just had a  very good tele-conference with Nation’s Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to "do more".
Leaving the GREAT STATE of OHIO for the @WhiteHouse. A really great day!
The wacky Ambassador that the U.K. foisted upon the United States is not someone we are thrilled with a very stupid guy. He should speak to his country and Prime Minister May about their failed Brexit negotiation and not be upset with my criticism of how badly it was...
The economy is looking really good. It has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers. The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better.
"No President in history has endured such vicious personal attacks by political opponents. Still the President’s record is unparalleled." @LouDobbs
...The Fake News will knowingly lie and demean in order make the tremendous success of the Trump Administration and me look as bad as possible. They use non-existent sources & write stories that are total fiction. Our Country is doing so well yet this is a sad day in America!
Axios (whatever that is) sat back and said GEEEEE let’s see what can we make up today to embarrass the President? Then they said "why don’t we say he wants to bomb a hurricane that should do it!" The media in our Country is totally out of control!
Governor Jerry "Moonbeam" Brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) Kidnapping and Robbery (2) Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) Dealing drugs. Is this really what the great people of California want? @FoxNews
Texas is healing fast thanks to all of the great men & women who have been working so hard. But still so much to do. Will be back tomorrow!
"I think the situation is unprecedented and there is no question about that. It’s whiplash! The economy was moving forward at a rapid pace in terms of growth jobs and even wage increases and all of a sudden the pandemic hit and the....
70 Record Closes for the Dow so far this year! We have NEVER had 70 Dow Records in a one year period. Wow!
....the only Collusion with Russia was with the Democrats so now they are looking at my Tweets (along with 53 million other people) - the rigged Witch Hunt continues! How stupid and unfair to our Country....And so the Fake News doesn’t waste my time with dumb questions NO....
Wow! Hunter Biden is being forced to leave a Chinese Company. Now watch the Fake News wrap their greasy and very protective arms around him. Only softball questions of him please!
"President Trump has something now he didn’t have a year ago that is a set of accomplishments that nobody can deny. The accomplishments are there look at his record he has had a very significant first year." @LouDobbs ShowDavid Asman & Ed Rollins
Just spoke to President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador. Will be helping them with Ventilators which are desperately needed. They have worked well with us on immigration at the Southern Border!
Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is "sick." All G 20 leaders and spouses were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!
While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec. 28 2017 was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28 2009 which was 47%...and this despite massive negative Trump coverage & Russia hoax!
The Fake News photoshopped pictures of Melania then propelled conspiracy theories that it’s actually not her by my side in Alabama and other places. They are only getting more deranged with time!
It would be really great if the people within the Trump Administration all well-meaning and good (I hope!) could stop hiring Never Trumpers who are worse than the Do Nothing Democrats. Nothing good will ever come from them!
.@WashTimes  "FBI Went Rogue In Pursuit Of Trump"
FAIR TRADE!
The Democrat controlled House never even asked John Bolton to testify. It is up to them not up to the Senate!
AP-NORC POLL: "Immigration among the top concerns in 2019." People want to stop drugs and criminals at the Border. Want Border Security! Tell the Dems to do the inevitable now rather than later. The wait is costly and dangerous!
Will someone please explain to the Fake News New York Times (ALL THE NEWS THAT’S NOT FIT TO PRINT) that the Democrats make it almost impossible for us to fill positions within government. They "maximum" delay even the best candidates including Judges leaving little time!
For those of you who are still interested the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA. Not a lot of interest on this subject from them!
I’ve employed thousands of Electrical Workers. They will be voting for me!
HOUSE REPUBLICANS SHOULD PASS THE STRONG BUT FAIR IMMIGRATION BILL KNOWN AS GOODLATTE II IN THEIR AFTERNOON VOTE TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE DEMS WON’T LET IT PASS IN THE SENATE. PASSAGE WILL SHOW THAT WE WANT STRONG BORDERS & SECURITY WHILE THE DEMS WANT OPEN BORDERS = CRIME.  WIN!
Impeachment Witch Hunt is now OVER! Ambassador Sondland asks U.S. President (me): "What do you want from Ukraine? I keep hearing all these different ideas & theories. What do you want? It was a very abrupt conversation. He was not in a good mood. He (the President) just said"...
Almost 70% in new Poll say don’t impeach. So ridiculous to even be talking about this subject when all of the crimes were committed by the other side. They can’t win the election fairly!
The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House. Wrong! People will always come & go and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision. I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection). There is no Chaos only great Energy!
The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections especially now that Republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in Polls. There was no Collusion except by the Democrats!
I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray a man of impeccable credentials to be the new Director of the FBI. Details to follow.
"We can’t beat him so lets impeach him!" Democrat Rep. Al Green
Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation headed up by the all Democrat loyalists or people that worked for Obama. Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter). No Collusion so they go crazy!
....for the more traditional but not very bright Sleepy Joe Biden. Here we go again Bernie but this time please show a little more anger and indignation when you get screwed!
"I don’t care what you think of the President...it cannot bleed over to the FBI...Comey is confirming there is bias in the FBI..." -Chris Swecker
... "Testing Testing Testing" again playing a very dangerous political game. States not the Federal Government should be doing the Testing - But we will work with the Governors and get it done. This is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex Ventilators!
Republicans will totally protect people with Pre-Existing Conditions Democrats will not! Vote Republican.
The Democratic National Committee sometimes referred to as the DNC is again working its magic in its quest to destroy Crazy Bernie Sanders....
Hit New Stock Market record again yesterday the 20th time this year with GREAT potential for the future. USA is where the action is. Companies and jobs are coming back like never before!
The forgotten voters of the 2016 Election are now doing great. The Steel Industry is rebuilding and expanding at a pace that it hasn’t seen in decades. Our Country has one of the best Economies in many years perhaps ever. Unemployment numbers best in 51 years. Wow!
Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U.S. keeps raising interest rates. Not acceptable!
.....Could be as high as 15 Million Barrels. Good (GREAT) news for everyone!
Where’s Hunter? He has totally disappeared! Now looks like he has raided and scammed even more countries! Media is AWOL.
.....Bob Corker was responsible for giving us the horrible Iran Nuclear Deal which I ended yet he badmouths me for wanting to bring our young people safely back home. Bob wanted to run and asked for my endorsement. I said NO and the game was over. #MAGA I LOVE TENNESSEE!
Just had a long and very good conversation by phone with President Xi of China. He is strong sharp and powerfully focused on leading the counterattack on the Coronavirus. He feels they are doing very well even building hospitals in a matter of only days. Nothing is easy but...
....Fake News got it wrong again as always and tens of thousands of lives were saved by my EARLY BAN of China into our Country. The people that we’re allowed were heavily scrutinized and tested U.S. citizens and as such I welcome them with open arms!
The Obstructionist Democrats have given us (or not fixed) some of the worst trade deals in World History. I am changing that fast!
If the Fed had done its job properly which it has not the Stock Market would have been up 5000 to 10000 additional points and GDP would have been well  over 4% instead of 3%...with almost no inflation. Quantitative tightening was a killer should have done the exact opposite!
READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!
The Senate Democrats have only confirmed 48 of 197 Presidential Nominees. They  can't win so all they do is slow things down & obstruct!
Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!
Democrats refusal to give even one vote for massive Tax Cuts is why we need Republican Roy Moore to win in Alabama. We need his vote on stopping crime illegal immigration Border Wall Military Pro Life V.A. Judges 2nd Amendment and more. No to Jones a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet!
Look forward to being in the Great State of Michigan tonight. Major business expansion and jobs pouring into your State. Auto companies expanding at record pace. Big crowd tonight will be live on T.V.
....and Safety at the Border or anywhere else. They know nothing about it and are making our Country unsafe. Our great Law Enforcement professionals MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB! If not there will be only bedlam chaos injury and death. We want the Constitution as written!
"The record is quite remarkable. The President has faithfully followed the agenda he campaigned on in 2016. People should focus on the results and they’re extraordinary!"  James Freeman - Wall Street Journal
The idea of a European Military didn’t work out too well in W.W. I or 2. But the U.S. was there for you and always will be. All we ask is that you pay your fair share of NATO. Germany is paying 1% while the U.S. pays 4.3% of a much larger GDP - to protect Europe. Fairness!
Great news for Republicans: Fred Keller has just won the hard fought for Pennsylvania Congressional contest in a LANDSLIDE over 70% of the vote. Thanks to the thousands who showed up for the Rally last night. Congratulations to Fred and his wonderful family!
Fake News @CNN and MSDNC have not surprisingly refused to talk about my record setting number of voters in New Hampshire (and in Iowa). That’s why they are poorly rated Fake News! I will win both states in November.
Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats...totally abandoned! Republicans are still working hard.
Great job being done by @BankofAmerica and many community banks throughout the country. Small businesses appreciate your work!
Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot. Big gain over last 4 weeks. I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans the Cuts the Dems want to take away. We need more Republicans!
WOW John James is making headway in Michigan. We are bringing jobs back to the State and the People of Michigan appreciate it. Debbie Stabenow has been no help if anything a major hindrance. John James is a star I hope the voters see it. Polls are tightening!
Pathetic excuse by London Mayor Sadiq Khan who had to think fast on his "no reason to be alarmed" statement. MSM is working hard to sell it!
Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County Florida. Will never forget them or the evening!
The call to the Ukrainian President was PERFECT. Read the Transcript! There was NOTHING said that was in any way wrong. Republicans don’t be led into the fools trap of saying it was not perfect but is not impeachable. No it is much stronger than that. NOTHING WAS DONE WRONG!
Great! Biden is finally being forced out of his basement. Now you’ll be able to see what is going on "up there". He may do some "limited" campaigning. Basement Biden is no longer playing well in the Polls!
JFK Files are being carefully released. In the end there will be great transparency. It is my hope to get just about everything to public!
My thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somalia. They are truly all HEROES.
Will be going to Camp David tomorrow morning for meetings on Border Security and many other topics with @WhiteHouse senior staff.
Chicago and New York City crime numbers are way up. 67 people shot in Chicago 13 killed. Shootings up significantly in NYC where people are demanding that @NYGovCuomo & @NYCMayor act now. Federal Government ready willing and able to help if asked!
Gina Haspel did a spectacular job today. There is nobody even close to run the CIA!
.....other than the fact that this Administration has probably done more than any other Administration in its first 2 1/2 years of existence. Anthony who would do anything to come back in should remember the only reason he is on TV and it’s not for being the Mooch!
The face of the Democrats is now Maxine Waters who together with Nancy Pelosi have established a fine leadership team. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats who want Open Borders and Unlimited Crime well into the future....and pick Crooked Hillary for Pres.
Now that our Country is "Transitioning back to Greatness" I am considering rescheduling the G-7 on the same or similar date in Washington D.C. at the legendary Camp David. The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all - normalization!
Cryin' Chuck Schumer stated recently "I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer." Then acts so indignant.  #draintheswamp
The U.S. has gained more than 5.2 trillion dollars in Stock Market Value since Election Day! Also record business enthusiasm.
I look forward to all meetings today with world leaders including my meeting with Vladimir Putin. Much to discuss.#G20Summit #USA🇺🇸
In new Quinnipiac Poll 66% of people feel the economy is "Excellent or Good." That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll.
Read the Transcript!
The Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania would absolutely die without the jobs and dollars brought in by Fracking. Massive numbers! Now Biden & Harris after Radical Left Dem Primaries are trying to change their stance. Pennsylvania wants Energy and Second Amendment!
Republicans cannot allow themselves to again lose the Senate seat in the Great State of Alabama. This time it will be for Six Years not just Two. I have NOTHING against Roy Moore and unlike many other Republican leaders wanted him to win. But he didn’t and probably won’t.....
Memorial service today for beautiful and incredible Heather Heyer a truly special young woman. She will be long remembered by all!
"The Obama White House had to immediately issue an apology for Joe Biden’s remarks and any alarm that he might have caused an alarm about a Swine Flu outbreak that took 6 months for President Obama to declare a National Emergency and that killed 12000 Americans." @LouDobbs
They gave General Flynn a great deal because they were embarrassed by the way he was treated - the FBI said he didn’t lie and they overrode the FBI. They want to scare everybody into making up stories that are not true by catching them in the smallest of misstatements. Sad!......
Rush Limbaugh to Republicans: "You can kiss the MIDTERMS goodbye if you don’t get highly qualified Kavanaugh approved."
....To the Gazan people — these terrorist acts against Israel will bring you nothing but more misery. END the violence and work towards peace - it can happen!
China which is a great economic power is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization. They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages especially over the U.S. Does anybody think this is fair. We were badly represented. The WTO is unfair to U.S.
It’s the Democrats fault they won’t give us the votes needed to pass good immigration legislation. They want open borders which breeds horrible crime. Republicans want security. But I am working on something - it never ends!
I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very 'cowardly!'
A complete Witch Hunt!
Slippery James Comey the worst FBI Director in history was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where by the way there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)!
Phoenix crowd last night was amazing - a packed house. I love the Great State of Arizona. Not a fan of Jeff Flake weak on crime & border!
House Democrats want to negotiate a $2 TRILLION spending increase but can’t even pass their own plan. We can’t afford it anyway and it’s not happening!
Just out: Consumer Confidence hits highest level since 2000.
So funny the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning. Now he R’s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material including Servers and Emails!
A woman I don’t know and to the best of my knowledge never met is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago. Never happened! Who would do this in a public space with live security......
Facebook Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous! Twitter in fact has made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump. They have removed many names & greatly slowed the level and speed of increase. They have acknowledged-done NOTHING!
Think of how many lives we saved in Syria and Turkey by getting a ceasefire yesterday. Thousands and thousands and maybe many more!
A great new book by Howie Carr "What Really Happened How Donald J. Trump Saved America From Hillary Clinton" is on sale now. Howie is a talented New England force who was there at the very beginning!
"If thinking that James Comey is not a good FBI Director is tantamount to being an agent of Russia than just list all the people that are agents of Russia - Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi Rod Rosenstein who wrote the memo to get rid of Comey the Inspector General...." Trey Gowdy
My son Donald will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 10:00 P.M. He is a great person who loves our country!
The great USMCA Trade Deal (Mexico & Canada) has been sitting on Nancy Pelosi’s desk for 8 months she doesn’t even know what it says & today after passing by a wide margin in the House Pelosi tried to take credit for it. Labor will vote for Trump. Trade deal is great for USA!
....Also why is Mueller only appointing Angry Dems some of whom have worked for Crooked Hillary others including himself have worked for Obama....And why isn’t Mueller looking at all of the criminal activity & real Russian Collusion on the Democrats side-Podesta Dossier?
The only crimes in the Impeachment Hoax were committed by Shifty Adam Schiff when he totally made up my phone conversation with the Ukrainian President and read it to Congress together with numerous others on Shifty’s side. Schiff should be Impeached and worse!
Guatemala which has been forming Caravans and sending large numbers of people some with criminal records to the United States has decided to break the deal they had with us on signing a necessary Safe Third Agreement. We were ready to go. Now we are looking at the "BAN"....
Add the 2026 World Cup to our long list of accomplishments!
Democrats in the Great State of Nevada (Which because of the Economy Jobs the Military & Vets I will win in November) be careful of Russia Russia Russia. According to Corrupt politician Adam "Shifty" Schiff they are pushing for Crazy Bernie Sanders to win. Vote!
Dow just hit 27000 for first time EVER!
The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff. He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!
Stock Market hits another all time high on Friday. 5.3 trillion dollars up since Election. Fake News doesn't spent much time on this!
There may or may not be National Security concerns with regard to Google and their relationship with China. If there is a problem we will find out about it. I sincerely hope there is not!!!
Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela. Should be landing in D.C. this evening and be in the White House with his family at about 7:00 P.M. The great people of Utah will be very happy!
I am pleased to announce that effective 4/9/18 @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor. I am very thankful for the service of General H.R. McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend. There will be an official contact handover on 4/9.
The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc. There is great Energy and unending Stamina both necessary to get things done. We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so! Fake News is going "bonkers!"
Was in the Great State of Texas this week and explained that the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats headed up by their great leader Sleepy Joe Biden (who never leaves his basement) are strongly against "Oil Gas Guns & God". Must be tough to win Texas on that platform!
Censure (at least) Corrupt Adam Schiff! After what he got caught doing any pol who does not so vote cannot be honest....are you listening Dems?
....this legislation with desperately needed immigration reform. We must have something good if not GREAT come out of these two tragic events!
We are building the Wall now but the reason the badly needed Wall wasn’t approved in the Republican controlled House and Senate was that we had a very slim majority in the Senate & needed 9 Democrat votes. They were totally unwilling to give Wall votes to us want Open Borders!
....the Border or large sections of the Border next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do but they just take our money and "talk." Besides we lose so much money with them especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.) that the Border closing would be a good thing!
Jobless Claims fell to their lowest level in 49 years!
Fake News is at an all time high. Where is their apology to me for all of the incorrect stories???
....testing that you should be doing. We have given New York far more money help and equipment than any other state by far & these great men & women who did the job never hear you say thanks. Your numbers are not good. Less talk and more action!
Dems have been complaining for months & months about Dir. Comey. Now that he has been fired they PRETEND to be aggrieved. Phony hypocrites!
....horrible BLM chant "Pigs In A Blanket Fry ‘Em Like Bacon". Maybe our GREAT Police who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them won’t let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York’s greatest street. Spend this money fighting crime instead!
Just had a great call with the President of Brazil @JairBolsonaro. We discussed many subjects including Trade. The relationship between the United States and Brazil has never been Stronger!
A truly great patriotic & charitable man Bernie Marcus the co-founder of Home Depot who at the age of 90 is coming under attack by the Radical Left Democrats with one of their often used weapons. They don’t want people to shop at those GREAT stores because he contributed....
....be able to produce what I have. So when you see those nasty ads from Big Pharma remember the only reason they are going all out is the massive PRICE REDUCTIONS you are getting - not good for them. Plus I was only President in 51 years that got a Prescription D reduction!
...be on the way and Americans want safe streets and communities!
By the way if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election it all took place during the Obama Admin. Why didn't they stop them?
Getting ready to leave for Poland after which I will travel to Germany for the G-20. Will be back on Saturday.
There has rarely been a juror so tainted as the forewoman in the Roger Stone case. Look at her background. She never revealed her hatred of "Trump" and Stone. She was totally biased as is the judge. Roger wasn’t even working on my campaign. Miscarriage of justice. Sad to watch!
Pelosi Nadler Schiff and of course Maxine Waters! Can you believe this?
So funny! I just checked out Fake News CNN for the first time in a long time (they are dying in the ratings) to see if they covered my takedown yesterday of Jim Acosta (actually a nice guy). They didn’t! But they did say I already lost in my meeting with Putin. Fake News......
Bob Woodward’s badly written book is very boring & totally "obsolete". Didn’t even talk about the recent Middle East deal. Just another tired washed up Trump Hater who can’t stand that I have done so much so quickly! #MAGA
As your President one would think that I would be thrilled with our very strong dollar. I am not! The Fed’s high interest rate level in comparison to other countries is keeping the dollar high making it more difficult for our great manufacturers like Caterpillar Boeing.....
....On Monday the flags will be at half-staff in honor of the men and women in our Military who have made the Ultimate Sacrifice for our Nation.
I am pleased to inform all of those that believe in a strong fair and sound Immigration Policy that Mark Morgan will be joining the Trump Administration as the head of our hard working men and women of ICE. Mark is a true believer and American Patriot. He will do a great job!
....bad Economic times the worse the better anything to make my Election more difficult to win. Well we are having very good meetings the Leaders are getting along very well and our Country economically is doing great - the talk of the world!
Someone should look into who paid for the small organized rallies yesterday. The election is over!
Both Commiecast MSNBC & Fake News CNN are watching their Ratings TANK.  Fredo on CNN is dying. Don’t know why @FoxNews wants to be more like them? They’ll all die together as other outlets take their place. Only pro Trump Fox shows do well. Rest are nothing. How’s Shep doing?
"The American Media has changed forever. News organizations that seemed like a big deal are now extinct.  Those that remain have now degraded themselves beyond recognition like the New Yorker - or they’ve been purchased by Jeff Bezos to conduct unregistered lobbying for.........
A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts (no chance). This is too good to be true for Republicans...Remember the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS-13 gang members...not good!
...sound horrible and me sound guilty. HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!
"There is no possible way the Trump Tower meeting between Don Trump jr and a couple of Russians who have very deep connections to both the Clintons & Fusion GPS & where no information on the Clintons was exchanged is a crime. Dems are blinded by their hatred of Trump." Bongino
Stock Market up 5 months in a row!
With Jemele Hill at the mike it is no wonder ESPN ratings have "tanked" in fact tanked so badly it is the talk of the industry!
Hoping things will work out with Israel's coalition formation and Bibi and I can continue to make the alliance between America and Israel stronger than ever. A lot more to do!
Read the Transcript. It is PERFECT!
What the Democrats are doing is "Obstruction of the Senate. It’s wrong Constitutionally it’s wrong morally and it’s wrong politically." @AlanDersh  @seanhannity  @dbongino l agree and so does the public!
....to your favorite President me! These people are vicious and totally crazed but remember there are far more great people ("Deplorables") in this country than bad. Do to them what they do to you. Fight for Bernie Marcus and Home Depot!
....But the questions should be asked why were all of Clinton’s people given immunity and why were the text messages of Peter S and his lover Lisa Page deleted and destroyed right after they left Mueller and after we requested them(this is Illegal)?
I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Counsel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion No Obstruction. Witch Hunt!
....This makes Nervous Nancy every bit as guilty as Liddle’ Adam Schiff for High Crimes and Misdemeanors and even Treason. I guess that means that they along with all of those that evilly "Colluded" with them must all be immediately Impeached!
Beautiful ceremony today in Paris commemorating the end of World War One. Many World leaders in attendance. Thank you to @EmmanuelMacron President of France! Now off to Suresnes American Cemetery to make speech in honor of our great heroes! Then back to the U.S.A.
One by one we are keeping our promises - on the border on energy on jobs on regulations. Big changes are happening!
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
JFK Files are released long ahead of schedule!
Marist/NPR/PBS Poll shows President Trump’s approval rating among Latinos going to 50% an increase in one year of 19%. Thank you working hard!
A.G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes...gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!
Going to be a BAD day for Crazy Bernie!
I was not pleased with the way that Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s trial was handled by the Navy. He was treated very badly but despite this was completely exonerated on all major charges. I then restored Eddie’s rank. Likewise large cost overruns from past administration’s.....
When will the Radical Left Wing Media apologize to me for knowingly getting the Russia Collusion Delusion story so wrong? The real story is about to happen! Why is @nytimes @washingtonpost @CNN @MSNBC allowed to be on Twitter & Facebook. Much of what they do is FAKE NEWS!
A very big CONGRATULATIONS to the great @seanhannity on having the Number One Book on the Planet "Live Free Or Die". The book is fantastic and so true. Keep Sean Number One!
Today we lost a great pioneer of air and space in John Glenn. He was a hero and inspired generations of future explorers. He will be missed.
.@GovMikeHuckabee "Your paycheck is bigger your pension is stronger." @foxandfriends  Unemployment numbers are better than they have been in 50 years & perhaps ever. Our country is booming like never before - and it will get even better! Many companies moving back to the U.S.A.
A poll should be done on which is the more dishonest and deceitful newspaper the Failing New York Times or the Amazon (lobbyist) Washington Post! They are both a disgrace to our Country the Enemy of the People but I just can’t seem to figure out which is worse? The good.....
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
Our big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of "love" - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses. This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of and now it is the rage. Merry Christmas!
Incredible job being done by FEMA First Responders Law Enforcement and all. Thank you!
Word is that Mini Mike Bloomberg performed so poorly in the two debates that he is thinking about dropping out of the Democrat Primary. The fact is he was not true to himself and the public was able to quickly figure him out. Not a good experience for Mini Mike!
We have 1800 ISIS Prisoners taken hostage in our final battles to destroy 100% of the Caliphate in Syria. Decisions are now being made as to what to do with these dangerous prisoners....
"The Democrats have now conceded that President Trump has not committed a crime." @AriFleischer
I will be signing our very large and comprehensive Phase One Trade Deal with China on January 15. The ceremony will take place at the White House. High level representatives of China will be present. At a later date I will be going to Beijing where talks will begin on Phase Two!
The rigged Dem Primary one of the biggest political stories in years got ZERO coverage on Fake News Network TV last night. Disgraceful!
Big attacks on Republicans and Conservatives by Social Media. Not good!
Michael Cohen’s book manuscript shows that he committed perjury on a scale not seen before. He must have forgotten about his book when he testified. What does Hillary Clinton’s lawyer Lanny Davis say about this one. Is he being paid by Crooked Hillary. Using her lawyer?
Corrupt politician Adam Schiff wants people from the White House to testify in his and Pelosi’s disgraceful Witch Hunt yet he will not allow a White House lawyer nor will he allow ANY of our requested witnesses. This is a first in due process and Congressional history!
5 for 5!
....Tax Returns. She’s a mess! Many books have been written about me some good some bad. Both happily and sadly there will be more to come!
Border rancher: "We’ve found prayer rugs out here. It’s unreal."  Washington Examiner   People coming across the Southern Border from many countries some of which would be a big surprise.
White House news conference at 5:45 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
I wonder if the New York Times will apologize to me a second time as they did after the 2016 Election. But this one will have to be a far bigger &  better apology. On this one they will have to get down on their knees & beg for forgiveness-they are truly the Enemy of the People!
Bad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall. They probably knew it was Fake News but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway. Two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise!
My thoughts and prayers are with the @KissimmeePolice and their loved ones. We are with you!#LESM
Canada charges the U.S. a 270%  tariff on Dairy Products! They didn’t tell you that did they? Not fair to our farmers!
Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos "you got to ask what was the purpose of the Special Counsel? There’s no there there." Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought!
"Barack Obama talked a lot about hope but Donald Trump delivered the American Dream. All the economic indicators what’s happening overseas Donald Trump has proven to be far more successful than Barack Obama. President Trump is delivering the American Dream." Jason Chaffetz
People are fleeing New York like never before. If they own a business they are twice as likely to flee. And if they are a victim of harassment by the A.G. of the state like what they are doing to our great NRA which I think will move quickly to Texas where they are loved.....
Agent Peter Strzok was just fired from the FBI - finally. The list of bad players in the FBI & DOJ gets longer & longer. Based on the fact that Strzok was in charge of the Witch Hunt will it be dropped? It is a total Hoax. No Collusion No Obstruction - I just fight back!
"Mueller was asked whether or not the investigation was impeded in any way and he said no." In other words there was NO OBSTRUCTION. @KatiePavlich @FoxNews
The Angry Majority!
All of this "Russia" talk right when the Republicans are making their big push for historic Tax Cuts & Reform. Is this coincidental? NOT!
Just out that the Obama Administration granted citizenship during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation to 2500 Iranians - including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?
The Impeachment Hoax is interfering with the 2020 Election - But that was the idea behind the Radical Left Do Nothing Dems Scam attack. They always knew I did nothing wrong!
Presidential Harassment!
....all deliveries of Fentanyl from China (or anywhere else!). Fentanyl kills 100000 Americans a year. President Xi said this would stop - it didn’t. Our Economy because of our gains in the last 2 1/2 years is MUCH larger than that of China. We will keep it that way!
Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned from President's Manufacturing Councilhe will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!
The Democrats never even mentioned the words LAW & ORDER at their National Convention. That’s where they are coming from. If I don’t win America’s Suburbs will be OVERRUN with Low Income Projects Anarchists Agitators Looters and of course "Friendly Protesters".
The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64% of the Trump Agenda is already done faster than even Ronald Reagan. "We’re blown away" said Thomas Binion of Heritage President Trump "is very active very conservative and very effective. Huge volume & spectrum of issues."
Remember when they were saying during the campaign that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff. Well not saying that anymore!
Big progress being made in ridding our country of MS-13 gang members and gang members in general. MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
Ex-FBI LAYER Lisa Page today defied a House of Representatives issued Subpoena to testify before Congress! Wow but is anybody really surprised!  Together with her lover FBI Agent Peter Strzok she worked on the Rigged Witch Hunt perhaps the most tainted and corrupt case EVER!
So now they are after the legendary "crime buster" and greatest Mayor in the history of NYC Rudy Giuliani. He may seem a little rough around the edges sometimes but he is also a great guy and wonderful lawyer. Such a one sided Witch Hunt going on in USA. Deep State. Shameful!
Schumer and the Democrats are big fans of being weak and passive with Iran. They have no clue as to the danger they would be inflicting on our Country. Iran is in financial chaos now because of the sanctions and Iran Deal termination. Dems put us in a bad place - but now good!
Senator Claire McCaskill of the GREAT State of Missouri flew around in a luxurious private jet during her RV tour of the state. RV’s are not for her. People are really upset so phony! Josh Hawley should win big and has my full endorsement.
Statement by me last night in Florida: "Honestly I don’t think the Democrats want to make a deal. They talk about DACA but they don’t want to help..We are ready willing and able to make a deal but they don’t want to. They don’t want security at the border they don’t want.....
Where’s the Collusion? They made up a phony crime called Collusion and when there was no Collusion they say there was Obstruction (of a phony crime that never existed). If you FIGHT BACK or say anything bad about the Rigged Witch Hunt they scream Obstruction!
Nancy Pelosi today on @GMA actually said that Adam Schiffty Schiff didn’t fabricate my words in a major speech before Congress. She either had no idea what she was saying in other words lost it or she lied. Even Clinton lover @GStephanopoulos strongly called her out. Sue her?
Wow! The Front Page @washingtonpost Headline reads "A BOOST IN TESTS BUT LACK OF TAKERS." We have done a great job on Ventilators Testing and everything else. Were left little by Obama. Over 11 million tests and going up fast. More than all countries in the world combined.
Jeff Sessions said he wouldn’t allow politics to influence him only because he doesn’t understand what is happening underneath his command position. Highly conflicted Bob Mueller and his gang of 17 Angry Dems are having a field day as real corruption goes untouched. No Collusion!
"Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign" No James Clapper I am not happy. Spying on a campaign would be illegal and a scandal to boot!
Read the Transcripts!
As it has turned out James Comey lied and leaked and totally protected Hillary Clinton. He was the best thing that ever happened to her!
We signed two pieces of major legislation this week Criminal Justice Reform and the Farm Bill. These are two Big Deals but all the Fake News Media wants to talk about is "the mistake" of bringing our young people back home from the Never Ending Wars. It all began 19 years ago!
The Intelligence people seem to be extremely passive and naive when it comes to the dangers of Iran. They are wrong! When I became President Iran was making trouble all over the Middle East and beyond. Since ending the terrible Iran Nuclear Deal they are MUCH different but....
"I like President Trump’s Tweets (Social Media) I like everything about him...and this Ukraine stuff the trial the impeachment this isn’t t about Ukraine. Donald Trump has committed the two unpardonable sins in the eyes of the Democrats. He beat Hillary Clinton in 2016 and..
WITCH HUNT!
The Democrats who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security are putting politics over Country. What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation including infrastructure unless it has perfect Border Security. U.S.A. WINS!
Good news out of the House with the passing of 'No Sanctuary for Criminals Act.' Hopefully Senate will follow.
"56% of registered voters tell Gallup that they are better off than they were 4 years ago (under Obama/Biden) while only 32% said they were worse off." Highest number on satisfaction yet recorded by far. mgoodwin@nypost.com... And it will only get better!!! VOTE
Dems are no longer talking DACA! "Out of sight out of mind" they say. DACA beneficiaries should not be happy. Nancy Pelosi truly doesn’t care about them. Republicans stand ready to make a deal!
....talks with Mexico will resume tomorrow with the understanding that if no agreement is reached Tariffs at the 5% level will begin on Monday with monthly increases as per schedule. The higher the Tariffs go the higher the number of companies that will move back to the USA!
The Radical Left Mayors &  Governors of Cities where this crazy violence is taking place have lost control of their "Movement". It wasn’t supposed to be like this but the Anarchists & Agitators got carried away and don’t listen anymore - even forced Slow Joe out of basement!
....great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being. Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire and now for no reason whatsoever his reputation has been shattered. Not fair Tester!
WITCH HUNT!
.....of money spent on protecting other countries and we get nothing but Trade Deficits and Losses. It is time that these very rich countries either pay the United States for its great military protection or protect themselves...and Trade must be made FREE and FAIR!
The Taliban has never been hit harder than it is being hit right now. Killing 12 people including one great American soldier was not a good idea. There are much better ways to set up a negotiation. The Taliban knows they made a big mistake and they have no idea how to recover!
"Congress cannot Impeach President Trump (did nothing wrong) because if they did they would be putting themselves above the law. The Constitution provides criteria for Impeachment - treason bribery high crimes &  misdemeanors. Unless there is compelling evidence Impeachment...
Just had a nice conversation with Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau of Canada. Great to hear that his wonderful wife Sophie is doing very well. The United States and Canada will continue to coordinate closely together on COVID-19.
The paid D.C. protesters are now ready to REALLY protest because they haven’t gotten their checks - in other words they weren’t paid! Screamers in Congress and outside were far too obvious - less professional than anticipated by those paying (or not paying) the bills!
....The Fake News Media builds Bob Mueller up as a Saint when in actuality he is the exact opposite. He is doing TREMENDOUS damage to our Criminal Justice System where he is only looking at one side and not the other. Heroes will come of this and it won’t be Mueller and his...
Tariffs are the greatest! Either a country which has treated the United States unfairly on Trade negotiates a fair deal or it gets hit with Tariffs. It’s as simple as that - and everybody’s talking! Remember we are the "piggy bank" that’s being robbed. All will be Great!
"This is all about undermining the next Election." Liz Peek @FoxNews
Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:55 A.M. USA STRONG!
So sad to see what is happening in New York where Governor Cuomo &  Mayor DeBlasio are letting out 900 Criminals some hardened & bad onto the sidewalks of our rapidly declining because of them city. The Radical Left Dems are killing our cities. NYPD Commissioner is resigning!
Dems Veronica Escobar and Jackson Lee purposely misquoted my call. I said I want you to do us (our Country!) a favor not me a favor. They know that but decided to LIE in order to make a fraudulent point! Very sad.
Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA!
"Fox News has learned that Bruce Ohr wrote Christopher Steele following the firing of James Comey saying that he was afraid the anti-Trump Russia probe will be exposed."  Charles Payne  @FoxBusiness   How much more does Mueller have to see? They have blinders on - RIGGED!
The "deplorables" came back to haunt Hillary.They expressed their feelings loud and clear. She spent big money but in the end had no game!
Read the Transcript!
I look forward to hosting right out of the great State of South Carolina the 2019 NCAA Football Champion Clemson Tigers at the White House on Monday January 14th. What a game what a coach what a team!
Billions of Dollars are pouring into the coffers of the U.S.A. because of the Tariffs being charged to China and there is a long way to go. If companies don’t want to pay Tariffs build in the U.S.A. Otherwise lets just make our Country richer than ever before!
"Not the Senate’s job to mop up the mess made in the House by the Democrats. Biden admitted that he went to Ukraine and did the Quid Pro Quo." @SteveScalise  @FoxNews
I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!
There is no amount of testimony or document production that can satisfy Jerry Nadler or Shifty Adam Schiff. It is now time to focus exclusively on properly running our great Country!
More and more people are suggesting that Republicans (and me) should be given Equal Time on T.V. when you look at the one-sided coverage?
China buys MUCH less from us than we buy from them by almost 500 Billion Dollars so we are in a fantastic position. Make your product at home in the USA and there is no Tariff. You can also buy from a non-Tariffed country instead of China. Many companies are leaving China.....
Working very well with States and our Nation’s Governors. #TEAMWORK
Great Army - Navy Game. Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF’S TROPHY! Congratulations!
"John Brennan is a stain on the Country we deserve better than this." Former Secret Service Agent and author of new book "Spygate the Attempted Sabotage of Donald J. Trump" Dan Bongino. Thank you Dan and good luck with the book!
....hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met saw or spoke to a Russian during this period? So many campaign workers people inside from the beginning ask me why they have not been called (they want to be). There was NO Collusion & Mueller knows it!
....Also there is NO COLLUSION!
New York State and its Governor Andrew Cuomo are now proud members of the group of PRESIDENTIAL HARASSERS. No wonder people are fleeing the State in record numbers. The Witch Hunt continues!
Brenda Snipes in charge of voting in Broward County Florida was just spotted wearing a beautiful dress with 300 I VOTED signs on it. Just kidding she is a fine very honorable and highly respected voting tactician!
Democrats campaigned on working within Washington and "getting things done!" How is that working out? #2020TAKEBACKTHEHOUSE
Republicans are doing really well with the Senate Midterms. Races that we were not even thinking about winning are now very close or even leading. Election night will be very interesting indeed!
Will be in Manchester New Hampshire tonight for a big Rally. Want to shake up the Dems a little bit - they have a really boring deal going on. Still waiting for the Iowa results votes were fried. Big crowds in Manchester!
Will be having lunch in White House residence with large group concerning Border Security.
3 Republicans and 48 Democrats let the American people down. As I said from the beginning let ObamaCare implode then deal. Watch!
....good practice." As you saw last night they were very cool & very professional. Never let it get out of hand. Thank you! On the bad side the D.C. Mayor @MurielBowser who is always looking for money & help wouldn’t let the D.C. Police get involved. "Not their job." Nice!
With Irma and Harvey devastation Tax Cuts and Tax Reform is needed more than ever before. Go Congress go!
For the record Denmark is only at 1.35% of GDP for NATO spending. They are a wealthy country and should be at 2%. We protect Europe and yet only 8 of the 28 NATO countries are at the 2% mark. The United States is at a much much higher level than that....
The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years. However if you don’t separate FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids!
Real estate developers in the 1980’s & 1990’s more than 30 years ago were entitled to massive write offs and depreciation which would if one was actively building show losses and tax losses in almost all cases. Much was non monetary. Sometimes considered "tax shelter" ......
The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border. Because of the Trump Administrations actions Border crossings are at a still UNACCEPTABLE 46 year low. Stop drugs!
Yesterday’s Never Trumper witness could find NO Quid Pro Quo in the Transcript of the phone call. There were many people listening to the call. How come they (including the President of Ukraine) found NOTHING wrong with it. Witch Hunt!
Can you imagine Cryin’ Chuck Schumer saying out loud for all to hear that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep. He would rather have our Country fail with drugs & Immigration than give Republicans a win. But he gave Mexico bad advice no bluff!
Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moat stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!
The Worker in America is doing better than ever before. Celebrate Labor Day!
Now we find out that Adam Schiff was spending time together in Aspen with Glenn Simpson of GPS Fusion who wrote the fake and discredited Dossier even though Simpson was testifying before Schiff. John Solomon of @thehill
Iran was violating the 150 Billion Dollar (plus 1.8 Billion Dollar in CASH) Nuclear Deal with the United States and others who paid NOTHING long before I became President - and they have now breached their stockpile limit. Not good!
Bernie Sanders "The Economy is doing well and I’m sure I don’t have to give Trump any credit - I’m sure he’ll take all the credit that he wants." Wrong Bernie the Economy is doing GREAT and would have CRASHED if my opponent (and yours) Crooked Hillary Clinton had ever won!
Despite the large Caravans that WERE forming and heading to our Country people have not been able to get through our newly built Walls makeshift Walls & Fences or Border Patrol Officers & Military. They are now staying in Mexico or going back to their original countries.......
If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now they should immediately REPEAL and then REPLACE at a later date!
"Sotomayor accuses GOP appointed Justices  of being biased in favor of Trump." @IngrahamAngle @FoxNews  This is a terrible thing to say. Trying to "shame" some into voting her way? She never criticized Justice Ginsberg when she called me a "faker". Both should recuse themselves..
....your release possible and HAVE A GREAT LIFE! Be careful there are many pitfalls on the long and winding road of life!
The Phony Witch Hunt continues but Mueller and his gang of Angry Dems are only looking at one side not the other. Wait until it comes out how horribly & viciously they are treating people ruining lives for them refusing to lie. Mueller is a conflicted prosecutor gone rogue....
Elizabeth "Pocahontas" Warren singlehandedly destroyed the Bernie Sanders campaign by stripping voters away from his count on Super T. He lost states that he easily would have won if she had dropped out 3 days earlier. The DNC is doing it to Bernie again! Will he ever get angry?
"Double Standard - Former FBI lawyer (Lisa Page) admits being told to go easy on Clinton."  Very unfair!  @FoxNews
...Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI and still hasn't? It's all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
Come on Republican Senators you can do it on Healthcare. After 7 years this is your chance to shine! Don't let the American people down!
The big story is the "unmasking and surveillance" of people that took place during the Obama Administration.
I have been briefed on the helicopter crash in New York City. Phenomenal job by our GREAT First Responders who are currently on the scene. THANK YOU for all you do 24/7/365! The Trump Administration stands ready should you need anything at all.
Under our potential deal with China they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce.
Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false. The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family. Tester should resign. The.....
Wonderful coordination between Federal State and Local Governments in the Great State of Texas - TEAMWORK! Record setting rainfall.
Can’t say I mind the fact that the great people of West Virginia are furious at their puppet Democrat Senator Joe Manchin. They will never forget his phony vote on the Impeachment Hoax. All he had to do is read the Transcripts sadly which he wouldn’t understand anyway.....
Just spoke to @JustinTrudeau to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible Humboldt Team tragedy. May God be with them all!
Why Isn't the Senate Intel Committee looking into the Fake News Networks in OUR country to see why so much of our news is just made up-FAKE!
Uganda must find the kidnappers of the American Tourist and guide before people will feel safe in going there. Bring them to justice openly and quickly!
....A total double standard. The only thing the Dems have going for them is their very close relationship with the Fake News Lamestream Media!
A group of RINO Republicans who failed badly 12 years ago then again 8 years ago and then got BADLY beaten by me a political first timer 4 years ago have copied (no imagination) the concept of an ad from Ronald Reagan "Morning in America" doing everything possible to....
Hard to believe that the Democrats who have gone so far LEFT that they are no longer recognizable are fighting so hard for Sanctuary crime
Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act. We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools. A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again!
Democrats should stop fighting Sen. David Perdue’s disaster relief bill. They are blocking funding and relief for our great farmers and rural America!
To the people of South Carolina Tom Steyer is a joke laughed at by everyone a total incompetent. He made money in coal now he "hates" coal. Did you see him fawning over Crazy Bernie? Has no chance a loser for South Carolina doesn’t deserve your vote!
Even President Ronald Reagan tried for 8 years to build a Border Wall or Fence and was unable to do so. Others also have tried. We will get it done one way or the other!
Law enforcement & military did a spectacular job in Hamburg. Everybody felt totally safe despite the anarchists. @PolizeiHamburg #G20Summit
Going with First Lady to pay our respects to Justice Stevens. Leaving now!
White House Press Conference at 5:15 P.M. Live!
....If this is done illegal immigration will be stopped in it’s tracks - and at very little by comparison cost. This is the only real answer - and we must continue to BUILD THE WALL!
Democrats had to quickly take down a tweet called "Kids In Cages Inhumane Treatment at the Border" because the horrible picture used was from the Obama years. Very embarrassing! @foxandfriends
There is a rumor put out by the Democrats that Josh Hawley of Missouri left the Arena last night early. It is Fake News. He met me at the plane when I arrived spoke at the great Rally & stayed to the very end. In fact I said goodbye to him and left before he did. Deception!
....We will get through this together and bats will be swinging before you know it. In the meantime take care of mom and dad and know that this will not be forever! @littleleagueceo
Wow! Morning Joe & Psycho ratings have really crashed. Very small audience. People are tired of hearing Fake News delivered with an anger that is not to be believed. Sad when the show was sane they helped get me elected. Thanks! Was on all the time. Lost all of its juice!
I will be having lunch at the White House today with Republican Senators concerning healthcare. They MUST keep their promise to America!
....Kelly has done an outstanding job representing our Nation and I have no doubt that under her leadership our Country will be represented at the highest level. Congratulations to Kelly and her entire family!
.....came from and in far safer conditions. No matter how good things actually look even if perfect the Democrat visitors will act shocked & aghast at how terrible things are. Just Pols. If they really want to fix them change the Immigration Laws and Loopholes. So easy to do!
Based on the strong recommendation of @SenDanSullivan and @repdonyoung of the Great State of Alaska it is my honor to inform you that I will be issuing a Presidential Permit for the A2A Cross-Border Rail between Alaska & Canada. Congratulations to the people of Alaska & Canada!
When I became President ISIS was out of control in Syria & running rampant. Since then tremendous progress made especially over last 5 weeks. Caliphate will soon be destroyed unthinkable two years ago. Negotiating are proceeding well in Afghanistan after 18 years of fighting..
...to the UNITED STATES! We have now brought more than 40 American hostages and detainees back home since I took office. Thank you to Iran it shows a deal is possible!
Great to be back from Vietnam an amazing place. We had very substantive negotiations with Kim Jong Un - we know what they want and they know what we must have. Relationship very good let’s see what happens!
All-Time High for Stock Market and all the Fake News wants to talk about is the Impeachment Hoax!
Shifty Adam Schiff will only release doctored transcripts. We haven’t even seen the documents and are restricted from (get this) having a lawyer. Republicans should put out their own transcripts! Schiff must testify as to why he MADE UP a statement from me and read it to all!
If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal...
I look forward to paying my respects to our brave men and women on this Memorial Day at Arlington National Cemetery later this morning.
I am pleased to inform you that I have just named General/Secretary John F Kelly as White House Chief of Staff. He is a Great American....
.@jimmyfallon is now whimpering to all that he did the famous "hair show" with me (where he seriously messed up my hair) & that he would have now done it differently because it is said to have "humanized" me-he is taking heat. He called & said "monster ratings." Be a man Jimmy!
"We’ve seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION....I have seen nothing the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he’s exercising his power as the President of the U.S. I just don’t see it."  Judge Ken Starr
....with the U.S. and wishes it had not broken the original deal in the first place. In the meantime we are receiving Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China with possibly much more to come. These Tariffs are paid for by China devaluing & pumping not by the U.S. taxpayer!
Campaigning for the Popular Vote is much easier & different than campaigning for the Electoral College. It’s like training for the 100 yard dash vs. a marathon. The brilliance of the Electoral College is that you must go to many States to win. With the Popular Vote you go to....
Republican Tax Cuts are looking very good. All are working hard. In the meantime the Stock Market hit another record high!
Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday. They were caught red handed just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his "mistake"). Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible or was it just gross incompetence?
Since Election Day on November 8 the Stock Market is up more than 25% unemployment is at a 17 year low & companies are coming back to U.S.
Gasoline Prices in the State of California are MUCH HIGHER than anywhere else in the Nation ($2.50 vs. $4.50). I guess those very expensive and unsafe cars that they are mandating just aren’t doing the trick! Don’t worry California relief is on the way. The State doesn’t get it!
Many people listened to my phone call with the Ukrainian President while it was being made. I never heard any complaints. The reason is that it was totally appropriate I say perfect. Republicans have never been more unified and my Republican Approval Rating is now 95%!
My highly respected nominee for CIA Director Gina Haspel has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists. Think of that in these very dangerous times we have the most qualified person a woman who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror. Win Gina!
After Turkey call I will be heading over to Trump National Golf Club Jupiter to play golf (quickly) with Tiger Woods and Dustin Johnson. Then back to Mar-a-Lago for talks on bringing even more jobs and companies back to the USA!
....In the meantime the Democrats in Congress must help the Republicans (we need their votes) to end the horrible costly and foolish loopholes in our Immigration Laws. Once that happens all will be smooth. We can NEVER allow Open Borders!
Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous  low. You can thank Congress the same people that can't even give us HCare!
With all of the Fake and Made Up News out there Iran can have no idea what is actually going on!
Hard to believe that @FoxNews will be interviewing sleazebag & totally discredited former FBI Director James Comey & also corrupt politician Adam "Shifty" Schiff. Fox is trying sooo hard to be politically correct and yet they were totally shut out from the failed Dem debates!
Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U.S. massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers. The EU trade surplus with the U.S. is $151 Billion and Canada keeps our farmers and others out. Look forward to seeing them tomorrow.
When we rip down and totally replace a badly broken and dilapidated Barrier on the Southern Border something which cannot do the job the Fake News Media gives us zero credit for building a new Wall. We have replaced many miles of old Barrier with powerful new Walls!
Congress now has 6 months to legalize DACA (something the Obama Administration was unable to do). If they can't I will revisit this issue!
Looking forward to 3:30 P.M. meeting today at the White House. We have to protect & build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends  and treat us fairly on both trade and the military.
In the highly competitive world of high tech how come nobody has ever challenged Mini Mike Bloomberg and his very average & supposedly outdated "stuff" that he sells to so many? Did he use his position as Mayor of New York to create what is now a monopoly? Just askin’?
Bringing hundreds of billions of dollars back to the U.S.A. from the Middle East - which will mean JOBS JOBS JOBS!
While the world is not doing well economically our Country is doing better perhaps than it has ever done before. Jobs Jobs Jobs!
I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.
ELECTION INTERFERENCE!
Can’t believe how badly @CNN has done in the newly released TV ratings. They are so far below @FoxNews (thank you President Trump!) that you can barely find them. Fredo should be given a big pay cut! MSDNC also did poorly. As I have long said Fake News does not pay!!!
Congratulations to Patrick Reed on his great and courageous MASTERS win! When Patrick had his amazing win at Doral 5 years ago people saw his great talent and a bright future ahead. Now he is the Masters Champion!
What I said on the phone call with the Ukrainian President is "perfectly" stated. There is no reason to call witnesses to analyze my words and meaning. This is just another Democrat Hoax that I have had to live with from the day I got elected (and before!). Disgraceful!
We have a State of Emergency at our Southern Border. Border Patrol our Military and local Law Enforcement are doing a great job but without the Wall which is now under major construction you cannot have Border Security. Drugs Gangs and Human Trafficking must be stopped!
Bootedgeedge (Buttigieg) is doing pretty well tonight. Giving Crazy Bernie a run for his money. Very interesting!
India has long had a field day putting Tariffs on American products. No longer acceptable!
Joe wants to shut down this Country. I want to keep it OPEN!
The FBI and Law Enforcement must focus their energy on ANTIFA and the Radical Left those who have spent the summer trying to burn down poorly run Democrat Cities throughout the USA!
"After two years and interviewing more than two hundred witnesses the Senate Intelligence Committee has NOT discovered any direct evidence of a conspiracy between the Trump Campaign and Russia."  Ken Dilanian @NBCNews
....It all comes from the top. They could have easily stopped the plague but they didn’t!
It is expected that China will be buying large amounts of our agricultural products!
"He’s got to explain this. How did Hunter Biden get a billion and a half dollars (from China) to invest when he’d been in business for 60 days?" @LindseyGrahamSC @FoxNews
The United States is asking Britain France Germany and other European allies to take back over 800 ISIS fighters that we captured in Syria and put them on trial. The Caliphate is ready to fall. The alternative is not a good one in that we will be forced to release them........
As I predicted 16 states led mostly by Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left have filed a lawsuit in of course the 9th Circuit! California the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train with no hope of completion seems in charge!
The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win..
Senator Chuck Schumer has finally gone to the Southern Border with some Democrat Senators. This is a GREAT thing! Nearby he missed a large group of Illegal Immigrants trying to enter the USA illegally. They wildly  rushed Border Patrol. Some Agents were badly injured....
Whether you call it Vote by Mail or Absentee Voting in Florida the election system is Safe and Secure Tried and True. Florida’s Voting system has been cleaned up (we defeated Democrats attempts at change) so in Florida I encourage all to request a Ballot & Vote by Mail! #MAGA
Headline: "Kim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U.S. Pledges Not to Invade" - from the Failing New York Times. Also will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May.
Unless the Republican Senators are total quitters Repeal & Replace is not dead! Demand another vote before voting on any other bill!
Despite No Collusion No Obstruction The Radical Left Democrats do not want to go on to Legislate for the good of the people but only to Investigate and waste time. This is costing our Country greatly and will cost the Dems big time in 2020!
A very bad night for Mini Mike!
When you give a crazed crying lowlife a break and give her a job at the White House I guess it just didn’t work out. Good work by General Kelly for quickly firing that dog!
Was @foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news? You deserve it - three great people! The many Fake News Hate Shows should study your formula for success!
Tonight we gathered to celebrate the courageous men and women who make freedom possible: our brave service members and our wonderful Veterans. For 242 years American Independence...
Illegal immigration costs the United States more than 200 Billion Dollars a year. How was this allowed to happen?
Our great country is respected again in Asia. You will see the fruits of our long but successful trip for many years to come!
WITCH HUNT!
On November 3rd Michigan will decide whether we will quickly return to record prosperity—or whether we allow Sleepy Joe Biden to impose a $4 TRILLION DOLLAR TAX HIKE ban American Energy confiscate your guns shutdown the economy shutdown auto production delay...
What many people don’t understand or don’t want to understand is that Wayne Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots. They love our Country and will do the right thing.                  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Hearing word that Russia Syria and to a lesser extent Iran are bombing the hell out of Idlib Province in Syria and indiscriminately killing many innocent civilians. The World is watching this butchery. What is the purpose what will it get you? STOP!
Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High along with a Record High Stock Market. Unemployment is at a 17 year low. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good).
The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace. Must have tough Primary!
Will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Russia continues to say they had nothing to do with Meddling in our Election! Where is the DNC Server and why didn’t Shady James Comey and the now disgraced FBI agents take and closely examine it? Why isn’t Hillary/Russia being looked at? So many questions so much corruption!
Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!
I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right unlike OCare!
....however for strictly political reasons and because they have been pulled so far left do NOT want Border Security. They want Open Borders for anyone to come in. This brings large scale crime and disease. Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way.......
Senator Feinstein and the Democrats held the letter for months only to release it with a bang after the hearings were OVER - done very purposefully to Obstruct & Resist & Delay. Let her testify or not and TAKE THE VOTE!
With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals (broke Harry Truman’s Record) Regulation Cutting Judicial Appointments Building Military VA TAX CUTS & REFORM Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news?
"Trump Urges Unity Vs. Racism" was the correct description in the first headline by the Failing New York Times but it was quickly changed to "Assailing Hate But Not Guns" after the Radical Left Democrats went absolutely CRAZY! Fake News - That’s what we’re up against...
....for another President. This is about PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT. We catch the other side SPYING on my campaign the biggest political crime and scandal in U.S. history and NOTHING HAPPENS. But despite this I have done more than any President in history in first 3 1/2 years!
Two months in jail for a Swamp Creature yet 9 years recommended for Roger Stone (who was not even working for the Trump Campaign). Gee that sounds very fair! Rogue prosecutors maybe? The Swamp! @foxandfriends @TuckerCarlson
Consumer confidence hits an 18 year high close to breaking the all-time record. A big jump from last 8 years. People are excited about the USA again! We are getting Bigger and Richer and Stronger. WAY MORE TO GO!
Thank you to former campaign adviser Michael Caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no Russian collusion in our winning campaign.
"This President is the most patriotic President I’ve seen in many years. He is going to do what is good for Americans."  Congressman Brian Babin Texas. Thank you Brian!
Mexico will try very hard and if they do that this will be a very successful agreement for both the United States and Mexico!
Good luck to Alice Johnson. Have a wonderful life!
"The circus is coming to town. The corrupt compromised coward & congenital liar Adam Schiff Show on Capital Hill brought to you by his raging psychotic Democrats & the top allies in the Media Mob. Everything you’re going to see in the next two weeks is rigged.....
"Thank you to Wayne Allyn Root for the very nice words. "President Trump is the greatest President for Jews and for Israel in the history of the world not just America he is the best President for Israel in the history of the world...and the Jewish people in Israel love him....
Landing in New Hampshire!
A vote for today’s resolution by Republican Senators is a vote for Nancy Pelosi Crime and the Open Border Democrats!
The Stock Market just reached an All-Time High during my Administration for the 102nd Time a presidential record by far for less than two years. So much potential as Trade and Military Deals are completed.
One of the reasons we need Great Border Security is that Mexico’s murder rate in 2017 increased by 27% to 31174 people killed a record! The Democrats want Open Borders. I want Maximum Border Security and respect for ICE and our great Law Enforcement Professionals! @FoxNews
....Likewise do not want the Kurds to provoke Turkey. Russia Iran and Syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term U.S. policy of destroying ISIS in Syria - natural enemies. We also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. Stop the ENDLESS WARS!
Elizabeth Warren is being hammered even by the Left. Her false claim of Indian heritage is only selling to VERY LOW I.Q. individuals!
Now that her claims of being of Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam and a lie Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetrating this fraud against the American Public. Harvard called her "a person of color" (amazing con) and would not have taken her otherwise!
Presidential Harassment!
Great being in New Hampshire last night. I would say that was the biggest political Rally in New Hampshire history. Incredible evening!
Based on the information released last night about the Fake Whistleblowers attorney the Impeachment Hoax should be ended IMMEDIATELY! There is no case except against the other side!
It is very hard and expensive to live in New York. Governor Andrew Cuomo uses his Attorney General as a bludgeoning tool for his own purposes. They sue on everything always in search of a crime. I even got sued on a Foundation which took Zero rent & expenses & gave away...
Those Republican Senators who voted in favor of Strong Border Security (and the Wall) are being uniformly praised as they return to their States. They know there is a National Emergency at the Southern Border and they had the courage to ACT. Great job!
"Trade Deals Drive Stocks To Record Highs." @FoxNews
Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida is one of the finest and most talented people in Congress. Strong on Crime the Border Illegal Immigration the 2nd Amendment our great Military & Vets Matt worked tirelessly on helping to get our Massive Tax Cuts. He has my Full Endorsement!
Jared Kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the Russians. Witch Hunt. Next up 11 year old Barron Trump!
If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago! Animal Assad would have been history!
So weird to watch @FoxNews interviewing only failed Dems like Represenative Tim Ryan of Ohio who got zero percent in his recent presidential run and following Sleepy Joe’s train to wherever. What a difference from the past - But we will win anyway!!!
Great Republican election results last night. So far we have the team we want. 8 for 9 in Special Elections. Red Wave!
Our Economy is doing better than ever. Money is pouring into our cherished DOLLAR like rarely before companies earnings are higher than ever inflation is low & business optimism is higher than it has ever been. For the first time in many decades we are protecting our workers!
In Florida there is a choice between a Harvard/Yale educated man named @RonDeSantisFL who has been a great Congressman and will be a great Governor - and a Dem who is a thief and who is Mayor of poorly run Tallahassee said to be one of the most corrupt cities in the Country!
Gina Haspel my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA is being praised for the fact that she has been and alway will be TOUGH ON TERROR! This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone. The CIA wants her to lead them into America’s  bright and glorious future!
Thank you @FoxNews "Huge win for President Trump and GOP in Georgia Congressional Special Election."
Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism? If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace!
The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. Wrong. I am VERY happy with my lawyers John Dowd Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow. They are doing a great job and.....
The Fake News is going crazy with wacky Congresswoman Wilson(D) who was SECRETLY on a very personal call and gave a total lie on content!
Everything a Governor asked the Federal Government for with respect to the Pandemic they got. They all said on tape the Federal government did a great job. Governor Cuomo used the word "phenomenal." The Task Force worked well with the States. Feds bailed out many States!
Great NRA crowd and enthusiasm in Indiana. Thank you! Leaving now for meetings in the Oval Office.
November 3rd. will be the most exciting day in U.S. Election History even more so than 2016. Tremendous excitement and enthusiasm like perhaps never seen before. Nobody showing up to Sleepy Joe Rallies. Places are DEAD. Stiff!!! See you in Florida tonight.
The Great State of West Virginia is producing record setting numbers and doing really well. When I became President it was practically shut down and closed for business. Not anymore!
Highly respected Congressman Keith Rothfus (R) of Pennsylvania is in the fight of his life because the Dems changed the District Map. He must win. Strong on crime borders big tax & reg cuts Military & Vets. Opponent Lamb a Pelosi puppet-weak on crime. BIG ENDORSEMENT FOR KEITH
Based on the historic currency manipulation by China it is now even more obvious to everyone that Americans are not paying for the Tariffs – they are being paid for compliments of China and the U.S. is taking in tens of Billions of Dollars! China has always....
The U.S. Post Office (System) has been failing for many decades. We simply want to MAKE THE POST OFFICE GREAT AGAIN while at the same time saving billions of dollars a year for American Taxpayers. Dems don’t have a clue! @USPostOffice911
...."knife crime" which is totally out of control in London. People are afraid to even walk the streets. He is a terrible mayor who should stay out of our business!
"Jay Leno points out that comedy (on the very boring late night shows) is totally one-sided. It’s tough when there’s only one topic." @foxandfriends  Actually the one-sided hatred on these shows is incredible and for me unwatchable. But remember WE are number one - President!
Big Rally in the Great State of South Carolina on Friday. See you there!
Obama was President up to and beyond the 2016 Election. So why didn’t he do something about Russian meddling?
Some of the Fake News Media likes to say that I am not totally engaged in healthcare. Wrong I know the subject well & want victory for U.S.
Another activist Obama appointed judge has just ruled against us on a section of the Southern Wall that is already under construction. This is a ruling against Border Security and in favor of crime drugs and human trafficking. We are asking for an expedited appeal!
General Michael Flynn the 33 year war hero who has served with distinction has not retained a good lawyer he has retained a GREAT LAWYER Sidney Powell. Best Wishes and Good Luck to them both!
.....there is not we can always go back to our previous very profitable position of Tariffs - But I don’t believe that will be necessary. The Failing @nytimes & ratings challenged @CNN will do anything possible to see our Country fail! They are truly The Enemy of the People!
Fox Poll say best Economy in DECADES!
Remember get out and Vote for Mike Garcia in CA25. A really big deal for our Country!
Mike Pompeo is outstanding. First in his class at West Point. A top student at Harvard Law School. A success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State!
Democrats in Congress must no longer Obstruct - vote to fix our terrible Immigration Laws now. I am watching what is going on from Europe - it would be soooo simple to fix. Judges run the system and illegals and traffickers know how it works. They are just using children!
It is INCREDIBLE to watch and read the Fake News and how they pull out all stops to protect Sleepy Joe Biden and his thrown out of the Military son Hunter who was handed $100000 a month (PlusPlus) from a Ukrainian based company even though he had no experience in energy...
The Fake News Media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with Russia even a confrontation that could lead to war. They are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that I’ll probably have a good relationship with Putin. We are doing MUCH better than any other country!
power from Washington D.C. and giving it back to you the American People. #InaugurationDay
I hope the discovery and eventual recovery of the Argentine submarine San Juan brings needed closure to the wonderful families of those brave missing sailors. I look forward to hearing more from my friend President @MauricioMacri in Argentina later this month.
Do you believe that the Fake News Media is pushing hard on a story that I am going to replace A.G. Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege? Do people really believe this stuff? So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt!
.@FLOTUS did a spectacular job hosting the President of France @EmmanuelMacron and his wife Brigitte. Every detail was done to perfection. The State Dining Room never looked more beautiful and Washington is abuzz over what an incredible job Melania did.
"Outrageous it’s the Adam Schiff problem. People abusing the access to classified data to then go out in public and make allegations that didn’t prove to be true. You look at a decision to essentially investigate a political rival. Who made it?" James Freeman @WSJ
I’ve been getting really good polls some over 50% except for one Fake Poll done by @ABC NEWS which gives NO INFORMATION about the sample R or D or anything else. They did this last Election with one week to go down 12 points and I won. They are disgusting Fake News!
Democrats are working hard to destroy the name and reputation of Crazy Bernie Sanders and take the nomination away from him!
Just got back to the White House from the Great States of Texas and Louisiana where things are going well. Such cooperation & coordination!
For a guy who couldn’t get approved for the Ambassador to the U.N. years ago couldn’t get approved for anything since "begged" me for a non Senate approved job which I gave him despite many saying "Don’t do it sir" takes the job mistakenly says "Libyan Model" on T.V. and..
Looks to me like it’s going to be SleepyCreepy Joe over Crazy Bernie. Everyone else is fading fast!
The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit  doesn't mean I think it can happen. It can't-but a ceasefire can& did!
Last night in Phoenix I read the things from my statements on Charlottesville that the Fake News Media didn't cover fairly. People got it!
With the great vote on Cutting Taxes this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOU!
....Large protests all across Venezuela today against Maduro. The fight for freedom has begun!
"I can die happy now with Trump Job performance" stated Mary Matalin. "A great overall President stunning!" Thank you Mary.
Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to after two weeks count their votes in Iowa. Hoax number 7!
Thank you Republicans. 185 out of 185 present voted for "US" last night. Really good!
SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history!
A government shutdown will be devastating to our military...something the Dems care very little about!
Elijah Cummings never even went to the Southern Border and then he screams at the very good people who despite Congresses failure to fix the Loopholes and Asylum make it work (crossings are way down and the Wall is being built). Even with zero Dem help Border getting strong!
DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon... No longer works. Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation. Democrats want No Borders hence drugs and crime!
Will be interviewed by @marklevinshow on @FoxNews tonight at 8:00 P.M. Enjoy!
Hiring manythousands of judges and going through a long and complicated legal process is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. People must simply be stopped at the Border and told they cannot come into the U.S. illegally. Children brought back to their country......
Going to New York. Will be with Prime Minister Abe of Japan tonight talking Military and Trade. We have done much to help Japan would like to see more of a reciprocal relationship. It will all work out!
I campaigned on Border Security which you cannot have without a strong and powerful Wall. Our Southern Border has long been an "Open Wound" where drugs criminals (including human traffickers) and illegals would pour into our Country. Dems should get back here an fix now!
As long as other countries are receiving the benefits of Negative Rates the USA should also accept the "GIFT". Big numbers!
As has been stated by numerous legal scholars I have the absolute right to PARDON myself but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong? In the meantime the never ending Witch Hunt led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms!
General Jim Mattis will be retiring with distinction at the end of February after having served my Administration as Secretary of Defense for the past two years. During Jim’s tenure tremendous progress has been made especially with respect to the purchase of new fighting....
Can’t believe they are bringing in John Dean the disgraced Nixon White House Counsel who is a paid CNN contributor. No Collusion - No Obstruction! Democrats just want a do-over which they’ll never get!
I have just instructed the Secretary of the Treasury to substantially increase Sanctions on the country of Iran!
The GDP Rate (4.2%) is higher than the Unemployment Rate (3.9%) for the first time in over 100 years!
New York’s Finest are not being allowed to perform their MAGIC but regardless and with the momentum that the Radical Left and others have been allowed to build they will need additional help. NYC is totally out of control. @NYCMayor & @NYGovCuomo MUST PUT DOWN RIOTING NOW!
Getting ready to leave for Cincinnati in the GREAT STATE of OHIO to meet with ObamaCare victims and talk Healthcare & also Infrastructure!
Congratulations to Judge Jeanine on the tremendous success of her new #1 best-selling book "Liars Leakers and Liberals – The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy!"
This is the coldest weather in the history of the Thanksgiving Day Parade in NYC and one of the coldest Thanksgivings on record!
In 2016 the ABC News/Washington Post Poll was such a complete disaster that these two Fake News Organizations changed the numbers prior to the Election. Now these haters are trying the same thing though on a lesser scale again. Will have a bigger win than even 2016!
Very good call yesterday with President Putin of Russia. Tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with Russia despite what you read and see in the Fake News Media. Look how they have misled you on "Russia Collusion." The World can be a better and safer place. Nice!
Never seen @senatemajldr and Republicans so united on an issue as they are on the Humanitarian Crisis & Security on our Southern Border. If we create a Wall or Barrier which prevents Criminals and Drugs from flowing into our Country Crime will go down by record numbers!
Will be interviewed tonight by Laura @IngrahamAngle at 10pmE on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
I am extremely happy and proud of the job being done by @USTreasury Secretary @StevenMnuchin1. The FAKE NEWS likes to write stories to the contrary quoting phony sources or jealous people but they aren’t true. They never like to ask me for a quote b/c it would kill their story.
Who the hell is Joy-Ann Reid? Never met her she knows ZERO about me has NO talent and truly doesn’t have the "it" factor needed for success in showbiz. Had a bad reputation and now works for the Comcast/NBC losers making up phony stories about me. Low Ratings. Fake News!
....I am pleased to announce that Kevin McAleenan the current U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner will become Acting Secretary for @DHSgov. I have confidence that Kevin will do a great job!
Now the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats are asking @senatemajldr Mitch McConnell to do the job that they were unable to do. They proved NOTHING but my total innocence in the House despite the most unfair & biased hearings in the history of Congress. Now they demand fairness!
Very sadly Murder cases in Mexico in 2018 rose 33% from 2017 to 33341. This is a big contributor to the Humanitarian Crisis taking place on our Southern Border and then spreading throughout our Country. Worse even than Afghanistan. Much caused by DRUGS. Wall is being built!
Wow! Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America’s lack of greatness. I have already MADE America Great Again just look at the markets jobs military- setting records and we will do even better. Andrew "choked" badly mistake!
Stock Markets Up Record Numbers. For this year alone Dow up 18.65% S&P up 24.36% Nasdaq Composite up 29.17%. "It’s the economy stupid."
The Trump base is far bigger &  stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling). Look at rallies in Penn Iowa Ohio.......
Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. The last thing our country needs is a Low Energy Individual especially when surrounded by High Energy Chess Players scattered all over the world. He’s back in his basement now - no schedule!
Sleepy Joe Biden’s victory in the South Carolina Democrat Primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg’s Joke of a campaign. After the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates  Mini Mike now has Biden split up his very few voters taking many away!
Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!
SO MUCH FAKE NEWS! The Lamestream Media has gone absolutely insane because they realize we are winning BIG in all of the polls that matter. They write or show one false story after another. They are truly sick people. VOTE!!!
Had the Fed not mistakenly raised interest rates especially since there is very little inflation and had they not done the ridiculously timed quantitative tightening the 3.0% GDP & Stock Market would have both been much higher & World Markets would be in a better place!
Just heard Fake News CNN is doing polls again despite the fact that their election polls were a WAY OFF disaster. Much higher ratings at Fox
The same people that got us into the Middle East Quicksand 8 Trillion Dollars and many thousands of lives (and millions of lives when you count the other side) are now fighting to keep us there. Don’t listen to people that haven’t got a clue. They have proven to be inept!
Cryin Chuck Schumer compared to what other Senators have brought home to their states has brought very little back to N.Y. A totally overrated loser the one thing he has given them is SALT. He never even called me to stop it. No wonder Cuomo & most others can’t stand him. AOC!
I am pleased to announce that our highly respected Ambassador to Germany @RichardGrenell will become the Acting Director of National Intelligence. Rick has represented our Country exceedingly well and I look forward to working with him. I would like to thank Joe Maguire....
....for Life in 2020. If we are foolish and do not stay UNITED as one all of our hard fought gains for Life can and will rapidly disappear!
Just met with @SundarPichai President of @Google who is obviously doing quite well. He stated strongly that he is totally committed to the U.S. Military not the Chinese Military....
The United States hasn’t had a Trade Surplus with China in 40 years. They must end unfair trade take down barriers and charge only Reciprocal Tariffs. The U.S. is losing $500 Billion a year and has been losing Billions of Dollars for decades. Cannot continue!
We are right where we want to be with China. Remember they broke the deal with us & tried to renegotiate. We will be taking in Tens of Billions of Dollars in Tariffs from China. Buyers of product can make it themselves in the USA (ideal) or buy it from non-Tariffed countries...
NASDAQ UP 72.2% SINCE OUR GREAT 2016 ELECTION VICTORY! DOW UP 55.8%. The best is yet to come!
....Some of those they are harshly treating have been "milking" their country for years!
ObamaCare premiums are going up up up just as I have been predicting for two years. ObamaCare is OWNED by the Democrats and it is a disaster. But do not worry. Even though the Dems want to Obstruct we will Repeal & Replace right after Tax Cuts!
"In my view General Flynn should never have been prosecuted in the first place." @Judgenap Judge Andrew Napolitano  @foxandfriends
Can anyone comprehend what a GREAT job Border Patrol and Law Enforcement is doing on our Southern Border. So far this year they have APPREHENDED 418000 plus illegal immigrants way up from last year. Mexico is doing very little for us. DEMS IN CONGRESS MUST ACT NOW!
The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the World. Oh’ great!
Just leaving the Great State of Ohio for New York and a few big days at the United Nations. Your Country will be well represented!
The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility. House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion Coordination or anything else with Russia. So now the Probe says OK what else is there? How about Obstruction for a made up phony crime.There is no O it’s called Fighting Back
Excellent Jobs Numbers just released - and I have only just begun. Many job stifling regulations continue to fall. Movement back to USA!
The United States has been spending Billions of Dollars a year on Illegal Immigration. This will not continue. Democrats must give us the votes to pass strong (but fair) laws. If not we will be forced to play a much tougher hand.
South Carolina was GREAT. A BIG & REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC CROWD!
"This is collusion illusion there is no smoking gun here. At this late date after all that we have gone through after millions have been spent we have no Russian Collusion. There is nothing impeachable here." @GeraldoRivera  Time for the Witch Hunt to END!
...the Uranium to Russia deal the  33000 plus deleted Emails the Comey fix and so much more. Instead they look at phony Trump/Russia....
Chuck Schumer is holding up 320 appointments (Ambassadors Executives etc.) of great people who have left jobs and given up so much in order to come into Government. Schumer and the Democrats continue to OBSTRUCT!
....a source of potential danger and conflict. They are testing Rockets (last week) and more and are coming very close to the edge. There economy is now crashing which is the only thing holding them back. Be careful of Iran. Perhaps Intelligence should go back to school!
The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media "screaming" for Crooked Hillary Clinton. Next she was a bad candidate!
The RNC has a great Chairwoman in Ronna McDaniel and the @GOP has never been stronger. We achieved historic wins with her help last year! #MAGA🇺🇸
...Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation use Nuclear Option if necessary to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job. Act now Congress our country is being stolen!
Making great progress in @Davos. Tremendous numbers of companies will be coming or returning to the USA. Hottest Economy! JOBS JOBS JOBS!
The Prosecutors who lost the case against SEAL Eddie Gallagher (who I released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly) were ridiculously given a Navy Achievement Medal. Not only did they lose the case they had difficulty with respect....
To show you how dishonest the LameStream Media is I used the word Liddle’ not Liddle in discribing Corrupt Congressman Liddle’ Adam Schiff. Low ratings @CNN purposely took the hyphen out and said I spelled the word little wrong. A small but never ending situation with CNN!
BIG RALLY tonight in Cincinnati Ohio. See you there! P.S. Our Country is doing GREAT!
Why is Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) perhaps in a near drunken state claiming he has information that only he and Bob Mueller the leader of the 13 Angry Democrats on a Witch Hunt knows? Isn’t this highly illegal. Is it being investigated?
.@ianbremmer now admits that he MADE UP "a completely ludicrous quote" attributing it to me. This is what’s going on in the age of Fake News. People think they can say anything and get away with it. Really the libel laws should be changed to hold Fake News Media accountable!
Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U.S. Catch and Release Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL! DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS.
Republicans are going to fight harder than ever to win back the House because of what the Do Nothing Democrats have done to our Country!
I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson and spoke his name from beginning without hesitation!
.@daveweigel of the Washington Post just admitted that his picture was a FAKE (fraud?) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when in fact he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on T.V.). FAKE NEWS he should be fired.
The Navy will NOT be taking away Warfighter and Navy Seal Eddie Gallagher’s Trident Pin. This case was handled very badly from the beginning. Get back to business!
...does not include the Fake Washington Post which is used as a "lobbyist" and should so  REGISTER. If the P.O. "increased its parcel rates Amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2.6 Billion." This Post Office scam must stop. Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now!
Ever since his vicious and totally false statements about Admiral Ron Jackson the highly respected White House Doctor for Obama Bush & me Senator John Tester looks to be in big trouble in the Great State of Montana! He behaved worse than the Democrat Mob did with Justice K!
Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State. The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people including the Ambassador to Germany. They are maxing out the time on approval process for all never happened before. Need more Republicans!
Big day for healthcare. Working hard!
Heading back to Washington D.C. Much will be accomplished this week on trade the military and security!
As ridiculous as it sounds the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from. A whole big wasted procedure must take place. Mexico & Canada have tough immigration laws whereas ours are an Obama joke. ACT CONGRESS
....will all end up going to the government anyway. Next up is Mary Trump a seldom seen niece who knows little about me says untruthful things about my wonderful parents (who couldn’t stand her!) and me and violated her NDA. She also broke the Law by givng out my....
We have a MASSIVE trade deficit with Germany plus they pay FAR LESS than they should on NATO & military. Very bad for U.S. This will change
Visited a great family of a young man under major surgery at the amazing Walter Reed Medical Center. Those are truly some of the best doctors anywhere in the world. Also began phase one of my yearly physical. Everything very good (great!). Will complete next year.
Great evening last night at the White House honoring Justice Kavanaugh and family. Our country is very proud of them!
So let’s get this straight! There was No Collusion and in fact the Phony Dossier was a Con Job that was paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. So the 13 Angry Democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up Fraud. I just fought back....
If Republicans don't Repeal and Replace the disastrous ObamaCare the repercussions will be far greater than any of them understand!
Great job being done by Dr. Nicole Saphier on @FoxNews!
"It should not be the job of America to replace regimes around the world. This is what President Trump recognized in Iraq that it was the biggest foreign policy disaster of the last several decades and he’s right...The generals still don’t get the mistake."  @RandPaul
"All that’s swirling around us now is Impeachment. We talk about it day and night it’s what’s on the news there is NOTHING that has turned up that is Impeachable. Our founding fathers set impeachment to be extremely rare. We need to get good stuff done. Let the people vote....
Watching Fake News CNN is better than watching Shepard Smith the lowest rated show on @FoxNews. Actually whenever possible I turn to @OANN!
I will be making two stops this morning in Japan to visit with our Great Military then a quick stop in Alaska and back to D.C. Meetings with Prime Minister Abe went very well and getting to spend time with the new Emperor and Empress of Japan was a great honor!
Republicans in Iowa go out and Caucus today. Your great Trade Deals with China Mexico Canada Japan South Korea and more are DONE. Great times are coming after waiting for decades for our Farmers Ranchers Manufacturers and ALL. Nobody else could have pulled this off!
....In the meantime my Administration is achieving things that have never been done before including unleashing perhaps the Greatest Economy in our Country’s history....
Imagine how much wasteful spending we’d save if we didn’t have Chuck and Nancy standing in our way! For years Democrats in Congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending and to what end? No more.
Completion of the Daytona 500 on Fox Network now. Enjoy!
I smile at Senators and others talking about how good free trade is for the U.S. What they don’t say is that we lose Jobs and over 800 Billion Dollars a year on really dumb Trade Deals....and these same countries Tariff us to death. These lawmakers are just fine with this!
S&P 500 HITS ALL-TIME HIGH  Congratulations USA!
Our Intelligence has informed us that the Chinese Government is moving troops to the Border with Hong Kong. Everyone should be calm and safe!
NO COLLUSION NO OBSTRUCTION NO NOTHING! "What the Democrats are trying to do is the biggest sin in the impeachment business." David Rivkin Constitutional Scholar. Meantime the Dems are getting nothing done in Congress. They are frozen stiff. Get back to work much to do!
Getting ready to land in Hawaii. Looking so much forward to meeting with our great Military/Veterans at Pearl Harbor!
....taken out of Ukraine and China. Additionally I demand transparency from Democrats that went to Ukraine and attempted to force the new President to do things that they wanted under the form of political threat.
"President is on sound legal ground to declare a National Emergency. There have been 58 National Emergencies declared since the law was enacted in 1976 and 31 right now that are currently active so this is hardly unprecedented." Congressman @tommcclintock
Isn’t it amazing that the people who were closest to me by far and knew the Campaign better than anyone were never even called to testify before Mueller. The reason is that the 18 Angry Democrats knew they would all say ‘NO COLLUSION’ and only very good things!
....in my conversation yesterday with President @EmmanuelMacron of France. I also wished both Pope Francis and President Macron a very Happy Easter!
John Kerry got caught essentially admitting that funds given ridiculously to Iran were used to fund attacks on the USA. Only a complete fool would have given that 150 Billion Dollars Plus to Iran. They then went on a Middle East Rampage! @foxandfriends @PeteHegseth
China talks are going very well!
Christopher Bedford The Federalist Senior Editor. "There is NOTHING NEW in these Emails at all that’s been discovered. It’s exactly what we knew before which is that the White House & political figures wanted to cut off aid Trump wanted to question aid to a number of....
White House news conference at 5:30 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions imposed on them in order to meet. I said of course NO!
The Fake News Media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony Russian Witch Hunt.
Spoke w/ President Erdogan of Turkey to advise where we stand on all matters including our last two weeks of success in fighting the remnants of ISIS and 20 mile safe zone. Also spoke about economic development between the U.S. & Turkey - great potential to substantially expand!
Just reminded my staff that Morning Joe & Psycho were with me in my room at their request the night I won New Hampshire. Likewise followed me to other states....
So weird to watch Crazy Bernie on @FoxNews. Not surprisingly @BretBaier and the "audience" was so smiley and nice. Very strange and now we have @donnabrazile?
Who’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt? They journeyed down to Washington D.C. with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...They went back home in tatters!
"Diagnosis positive: @CNN is infected with Trump Derangement Syndrome. I’m calling out CNN for irresponsibly politicizing what should be a unifying battle against a virus that doesn’t choose sides." @trish_regan @FoxNews  Like I say they are Fake News!
I hope everyone in the Great State of Virginia will get out and VOTE on Tuesday in all of the local and state elections to send a signal to D.C. that you want lower taxes a strong Military Border & 2nd Amendment great healthcare and must take care of our Vets. VOTE REPUBLICAN
Incredible number just out 7036000 job openings. Astonishing - it’s all working! Stock Market up big on tremendous potential of USA. Also Strong Profits. We are Number One in World by far!
Great numbers on the economy. All of our work including the passage of many bills & regulation killing Executive Orders now kicking in!
So nice being with Republican Senators today. Multiple standing ovations! Most are great people who want big Tax Cuts and success for U.S.
RUSH LIMBAUGH  "If the FBI was so concerned and if they weren’t targeting Trump they should have told Trump. If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax) then why not try to stop it? Why not tell Trump? Because they were pushing this scam."
Will be going to Detroit Michigan (love) today for a big meeting on bringing back car production to State & U.S. Already happening!
It is disgraceful what the Do Nothing Democrats are doing (the Impeachment Scam) but it is also disgraceful what they are NOT doing namely the USMCA vote Prescription Drug Price Reduction Gun Safety Infrastructure and much more!
....the 2016 election with interviews speeches and social media. I had to beat #FakeNews and did. We will continue to WIN!
Happy Passover to everyone celebrating in the United States of America Israel and around the world. #ChagSameach
"Democrats are frantic to throw something else at the President. That’s why you saw those 81 subpoenas. It’s ridiculous. Just because your still upset over an election that happened 2 1/2 years ago you should not be allowed to ruin people’s lives like this." Lara Trump @FoxNews
...Funny thing about James Comey. Everybody wanted him fired Republican and Democrat alike. After the rigged & botched Crooked Hillary investigation where she was interviewed on July 4th Weekend not recorded or sworn in and where she said she didn’t know anything (a lie)....
I was elected on getting out of these ridiculous endless wars where our great Military functions as a policing operation to the benefit of people who don’t even like the USA. The two most unhappy countries at this move are Russia & China because they love seeing us bogged.....
The LameStream Media has gone totally CRAZY! They write whatever they want seldom have sources (even though they say they do) never do "fact checking" anymore and are only looking for the "kill." They take good news and make it bad. They are now beyond Fake they are Corrupt..
I am committed to keeping our air and water clean but always remember that economic growth enhances environmental protection. Jobs matter!
Schiff is giving Republicans NO WITNESSES NO LAWYER & NO DUE PROCESS! It is a totally one sided Witch Hunt. This can’t be making the Democrats look good. Such a farce!
Democrat "leadership" despite their denials are putting tremendous pressure on their members to vote yes on this ridiculous Impeachment. If they vote yes it will be much easier for Republicans to win in 2020!
Fake News is at it again! They will take any statement from me no matter how proper or well delivered &  systematically in complete conjunction with all of their allies dismantle it. With Biden they only give him softballs and let him read the answers from a teleprompter!
The Democrats are "Border Deniers." They refuse to see or acknowledge the Death Crime Drugs and Human Trafficking at our Southern Border!
"At least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information."  Wall Street Journal
....We thank Attorney General Jeff Sessions for his service and wish him well! A permanent replacement will be nominated at a later date.
Could somebody at @foxnews please explain to Trump hater A.B. Stoddard (zero talent!) and @TeamCavuto that I won every one of my debates from beginning to end. Check the polls taken immediately after the debates. The debates got me elected. Must be Fox Board Member Paul Ryan!
The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough was not a Donald Trump original thought this has been going on for years long before I joined the chorus. In 2016 when Joe & his wacky future ex-wife Mika would endlessly interview me I would always be thinking....
In the end here nothing happened. We don’t approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a President should be removed from office. I believe that a President can’t be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the Senate..
House Democrats want a SHUTDOWN for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular just passed Tax Cuts. House Republicans don’t let this happen. Pass the C.R. TODAY and keep our Government OPEN!
....I know Emmanuel means well as do all others but nobody speaks for the United States but the United States itself. No one is authorized in any way shape or form to represent us!
Why isn't the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia Russian speech....
.@RepRatcliffe asked the two "star" witnesses "where is the impeachable event in that call?" Both stared straight ahead with a blank look on their face remained silent & were unable to answer the question. That would be the end of a case run by normal people! - but not Shifty!
To the three UCLA basketball players I say:  You're welcome go out and give a big Thank You to President Xi Jinping of China who made.....
My wonderful daughter Ivanka will be interviewed tonight by Steve Hilton on "The Next Revolution." @FoxNews 9:00 P.M. She works so hard and has achieved so much for the U.S.A.(and gets so little credit!). Then watch Mark Levin at 10:00 P.M. a great show!
Joe Biden is not on the side of Law Enforcement and that was spectacularly evident on my very successful trip yesterday to Kenosha. We solved the problem quickly and it was very much appreciated by the people of Wisconsin. Joe Biden wouldn’t know where to begin - a bad record!
...have it. Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize). Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?
Looking forward to being with the Bush Family to pay my respects to President George H.W. Bush.
...massive regulation cuts 36 new legislative bills signed great new S.C.Justice and Infrastructure Healthcare and Tax Cuts in works!
Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office "begging" for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them) is now in the ring fighting against Trump. Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!
I was saddened to learn of the recent passing of Bob Morgenthau a truly great man! Bob served as a Naval Officer in World War II was an extraordinary US Attorney Manhattan District Attorney and always a warrior for our Country that he loved so dearly....
NEW BOOK - A MUST READ! "The Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump" by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett. A sad chapter for law enforcement. A rigged system!
Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling why no action? Focus on them not T!
I never in my wildest dreams thought my name would in any way be associated with the ugly word Impeachment! The calls (Transcripts) were PERFECT there was NOTHING said that was wrong. No pressure on Ukraine. Great corruption & dishonesty by Schiff on the other side!
...way up. Regulations way down. 600000+ new jobs added. Unemployment down to 4.3%. Business and economic enthusiasm way up- record levels!
So if the so-called "Whistleblower" has all second hand information and almost everything he has said about my "perfect" call with the Ukrainian President is wrong (much to the embarrassment of Pelosi & Schiff) why aren’t we entitled to interview & learn everything about....
Remember Stock Market at an All Time High and going up. 401k’s at RECORD. With Sleepy Joe comes Tax Increases jobs losses and DEPRESSION like never seen before!!! VOTE!!!
Why isn’t disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe’s wife in her run for office? Then dropped case on Clinton!
When a politician admits that "We’re not going to make America great again" there doesn’t seem to be much reason to ever vote for him. This could be a career threatening statement by Andrew Cuomo with many wanting him to resign-he will get higher ratings than his brother Chris!
Not only are the Do Nothing Democrats interfering in the 2020 Election but they are continuing to interfere in the 2016 Election. They must be stopped!
Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs I wonder what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off?  Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness!
Our great Judge Jeanine Pirro is out with a new book "Liars Leakers and Liberals the Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy" which is fantastic. Go get it!
Sohrab Ahmari New York Post "The Trump Campaign raised $10 million in the two days following the impeachment (Scam) vote. It seems the Democrats have shot themselves in the foot in one more way. They set up a process they know is not going to lead to the Presidents removal &...
In all fairness Nancy Pelosi deserves to be chosen Speaker of the House by the Democrats. If they give her a hard time perhaps we will add some Republican votes. She has earned this great honor!
Just announced youth unemployment is at a 50 year low!  @foxandfriends
Washington Post got it wrong as usual. The U.S. is charging 25% against 250 Billion Dollars of goods shipped from China not 200 BD. Also China is paying a heavy cost in that they will subsidize goods to keep them coming devalue their currency yet companies are moving to.....
A highly respected Federal judge today stated that the "Trump Administration gets great credit" for reuniting illegal families. Thank you and please look at the previous administrations record - not good!
Comey gave Strozk his marching orders. Mueller is Comey’s best friend. Witch Hunt!
....However out of respect for the Bush Family and former President George H.W. Bush we will wait until after the funeral to have a press conference.
"GOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton." @FoxNews   Good luck with that request!
Steve Scully of @cspan had a very bad week. When his name was announced I said he would not be appropriate because of conflicts. I was right! Then he said he was hacked he wasn’t. I was right again! But his biggest mistake was "confiding" in a lowlife loser like the Mooch. Sad!
There is no reason for the U.S. Consumer to pay the Tariffs which take effect on China today. This has been proven recently when only 4 points were paid by the U.S. 21 points by China because China subsidizes product to such a large degree. Also the Tariffs can be.....
"Why doesn’t the press apologize to President Trump for the Russian Collusion Delusion?" @marklevinshow  @JudgeJeanine  How about the Dems also?
"I like the fact that the President is making the case (Border Security & Crime) to the American people. Now we know where Nancy Pelosi Chuck Schumer & the Democrats stand which is no Border Security. Will be big 2020 issue." Matt Schlapp Chair ACU. Bigger than anyone knows!
Stock Market hits new Record High. Confidence and enthusiasm abound. More great numbers coming out!
So if there was knowingly & acknowledged to be "zero" crime when the Special Counsel was appointed and if the appointment was made based on the Fake Dossier (paid for by Crooked Hillary) and now disgraced Andrew McCabe (he & all stated no crime) then the Special Counsel.......
Some members of the media are very Angry at the Fake Story in the New York Times. They actually called to complain and apologize - a big step forward. From the day I announced the Times has been Fake News and with their disgusting new Board Member it will only get worse!
I never said "give teachers guns" like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC. What I said was to look at the possibility of giving "concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best. 20% of teachers a lot would now be able to
....unbelievably lucky to have him and I’m just awed at how well they’ve done. It’s all the Trump magic - Trump is the magic man. Incredible he’s got the entire media against him attacking him every day and he pulls out these enormous wins." Ben Stein "The Capitalist Code"
....Knowing all of this is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader while on such a potentially "heavily populated" call. I would only do what is right anyway and only do good for the USA!
...over the last number of nights. If she doesn’t treat these men and women well then we’ll bring in a different group of men and women!
....Another is a one-time BAD Congressman from Illinois who lost in his second term by a landslide then failed in radio. The third is a man who couldn’t stand up straight while receiving an award. I should be able to take them!
Unlike Senator Manchin Big Jim Justice was very loyal to your favorite President during Pelosi’s Impeachment Scam. Big Jim is doing a tremendous job for West Virginia. Vote for Big Jim! #MAGA
....Likewise the @nytimes and @washingtonpost are a disgrace to journalism. They are all Fake News and they know it better than anyone else. History is unfolding and it is not a pretty picture for "journalism".
Without the horror show that is the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats the Stock Markets and Economy would be even better if that is possible and the Border would be closed to the evil of Drugs Gangs and all other problems! #2020
"Look how they’re acting now and how we act when we’re in the majority. What the Democrats are doing is an abuse of power. They couldn’t find anything...they took a Fake Dossier & couldn’t find any Collusion. Now they have a fake witness in Cohen." Congressman Mark Green (R-TN).
I never "lashed out" at the Acting Attorney General of the U.S. a man for whom I have great respect. This is a made up story one of many by the Fake News Media!
When you’re already $500 Billion DOWN you can’t lose!
....Tariffs Remittance Fees or all of the above. Guatemala has not been good. Big U.S. taxpayer dollars going to them was cut off by me 9 months ago.
Everybody is with Tomi Lahren a truly outstanding and respected young woman! @foxandfriends
Mitch McConnell announced he will cancel the Senate’s August Recess. Great maybe the Democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of High Crime and High Taxes. We need Border Security!
So why aren't the Committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered A.G. looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes & Russia relations?
Stock Market up BIG! Record highs for S&P 500 and NASDAQ. Enjoy!
Retired Four Star General Jack Keane will receive the PRESIDENTIAL MEDAL OF FREEDOM next week!
Remember Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional Races this year. The media refuses to mention this. I said Gillespie and Moore would lose (for very different reasons) and they did. I also predicted  "I" would win. Republicans will do well in 2018 very well! @foxandfriends
Will be doing show with @RushLimbaughEIB at 12:00 P.M. TALK RADIO.  ENJOY!!!
The Democrats made up and pushed the Russian story as an excuse for running a terrible campaign. Big advantage in Electoral College & lost!
The Paycheck Protection Program is up and running! The program is open to nonprofits as well so banks be sure to sign up our Great Religious and Veteran Organizations that need help!
Things are really getting ridiculous. The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the World’s most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the World!
The Federal Reserve must FINALLY lower the Fed Rate to something comparable to their competitor Central Banks. Jay Powell and group are putting us at a decided economic & physiological disadvantage. Should never have been this way. Also STIMULATE!
Wow the highest rated (by far) morning show @foxandfriends is on the Front Lawn of the White House. Maybe I’ll have to take an unannounced trip down to see them?
Europe has to pay their fair share for Military Protection. The European Union for many years has taken advantage of us on Trade and then they don’t live up to their Military commitment through NATO. Things must change fast!
I also have constantly asked "Why aren’t Germany France and other European countries helping Ukraine more? They are the biggest beneficiaries. Why is it always the good ol’ United States?" The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats never mention this at their phony hearing!
One of the worst polls in 2016 was the @FoxNews Poll. They were so ridiculously wrong. Fox said they were going to change pollsters but they didn’t. They totally over sample Democrats to a point that a child could see what is going on. Rasmussen which was accurate at 52%.
There wasn’t ANYTHING said wrong in my conversation with the Ukrainian President. This is a Democrat Scam!
I don’t think the Dems on the Border Committee are being allowed by their leaders to make a deal. They are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now out of the blue want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!
From the day I announced I was running for President I have NEVER had a good @FoxNews Poll. Whoever their Pollster is they suck. But @FoxNews is also much different than it used to be in the good old days. With people like Andrew Napolitano who wanted to be a Supreme....
Workers of firm involved with the discredited and Fake Dossier take the 5th. Who paid for it Russia the FBI or the Dems (or all)?

After more than two years of Presidential Harassment the only things that have been proven is that Democrats and other broke the law. The hostile Cohen testimony given by a liar to reduce his prison time proved no Collusion! His just written book manuscript showed what he.....
I am in Milwaukee Wisconsin for meetings. Soon to leave for a big groundbreaking for Foxconn which is building a great new electronics plant in Wisconsin. 15000 Jobs so great!
Heading to Camp David for major meeting on National Security the Border and the Military (which we are rapidly building to strongest ever).
Had very productive meetings and calls for our Country today. Meeting tonight with World Leaders!
Governor @GavinNewsom of California won’t let restaurants beaches and stores open but he installs a voting booth system in a highly Democrat area (supposed to be mail in ballots only) because our great candidate @MikeGarcia2020 is winning by a lot. CA25  Rigged Election!
Tainted (no very dishonest?) FBI "agent’s role in Clinton probe under review." Led Clinton Email probe. @foxandfriends  Clinton money going to wife of another FBI agent in charge.
....The U.S. does not want to watch as these ISIS fighters permeate Europe which is where they are expected to go. We do so much and spend so much - Time for others to step up and do the job that they are so capable of doing. We are pulling back after 100% Caliphate victory!
....happen again. Just like we can’t let large scale Mail-In Ballots take root in our Country. It would be a free for all on cheating forgery and the theft of Ballots. Whoever cheated the most would win. Likewise Social Media. Clean up your act NOW!!!!
....President Trump deserves a lot of credit but again you have the anti-Trump people who are not going to give him a lot of credit."
Wow Strzok-Page the incompetent & corrupt FBI lovers have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December 2015. SPYGATE is in full force! Is the Mainstream Media interested yet? Big stuff!
Impeachment King Steyer (how did that work out?) spent 200 Million Dollars and got less than 1% of the vote in Iowa and only 3% of the Vote in New Hampshire. Could it be that something is just plain missing? Not easy to do what I did is it?
Great interview this morning by @foxandfriends with some of the fantastic people who attended the big Rally last night in Toledo Ohio. Thank you. Such amazing energy!
....As well as we are doing from the day after the great Election when the Market shot right up it could have been even better - massive additional wealth would have been created & used very well. Our most difficult problem is not our competitors it is the Federal Reserve!
Good things are happening at China Trade Talk Meeting. Warmer feelings than in recent past more like the Old Days. I will be meeting with the Vice Premier today. All would like to see something significant happen!
The Wall Street Journal has it wrong we are under no pressure to make a deal with China they are under pressure to make a deal with us. Our markets are surging theirs are collapsing. We will soon be taking in Billions in Tariffs & making products at home. If we meet we meet?
Countries are coming to us wanting to negotiate REAL trade deals not the one sided horror show deals made by past administrations. They don’t want to be targeted for Tariffs by the U.S.
....Together we built the greatest economy in history. We will do it again – better than ever before!
Just returning from the Great State of Minnesota where we had an incredible rally with 9000 people and at least 10000 who could not get in - I will return! Congratulations to @PeteStauber who is loved and respected in Minnesota!
Iran the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate. Not good!
The Al Frankenstien picture is really bad speaks a thousand words. Where do his hands go in pictures 2 3 4 5 & 6 while she sleeps? .....
Poll numbers have gone through the roof in favor of No Impeachment especially with Swing States and Independents in Swing States. People have figured out that the Democrats have no case it is a total Hoax. Even Pelosi admitted yesterday that she began this scam 2 1/2 years ago!
The Greatest Witch Hunt in the history of our Country!
A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them. If they move watch it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!
New Fox Poll: 58% of people say that the FBI broke the law in investigating Donald J. Trump. @foxandfriends
Being scolded by failed former "Intelligence" officials like James Clapper on my condolences to Iran on their failed Rocket launch. Sadly for the United States guys like him Comey and the even dumber John Brennan don’t have a clue. They really set our Country back....
Big day! Pastor Andrew Brunson who could have spent 35 years in a Turkish prison was returned safely home to his family today. Met in Oval Office great people! Then off to Kentucky for a Rally for Congressman Andy Barr. Tremendous crowd & spirit! Just returned to White House.
So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the "unsolved mystery" that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!
Rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople of the Manufacturing Council & Strategy & Policy Forum I am ending both. Thank you all!
As the phony Russian Witch Hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold Democrats and Russians!
The United States has VERY LOW INFLATION a beautiful thing!
Just landed in Florida. WOW what a crowd MASSIVE! Going to win FLORIDA BIG!! Live on @FoxNews @OANN and @cspan! #MAGA
Our Social Media (and beyond) Stars @DiamondandSilk are terrific people who are doing really well. We are all very proud of them and their great success!
Our thoughts and prayers are with the four U.S. Marines from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing who lost their lives in yesterday’s Southern California helicopter crash. We pray for their families and our great @USMC.
The military drills or war games as I call them were never even discussed in my mtg w/ Kim Jong Un of NK—FAKE NEWS! I made that decision long ago because it costs the U.S. far too much money to have those "games" especially since we are not reimbursed for the tremendous cost!
...What about all of the Clinton ties to Russia including Podesta Company Uranium deal Russian Reset big dollar speeches etc.
Watched some of the Fake News Political Shows this morning and continue to be amazed at how every question is asked in the most negative way. The Mainstream Media should be ashamed of itself - But the good news is that the USA is wise to your game of dishonesty and deception!
Russian officials must be laughing at the U.S. & how a lame excuse for why the Dems lost the election has taken over the Fake News.
The U.S. has more than double the growth rate than it had 18 months ago.
..under a magnifying glass they have zero "tapes" of T people colluding. There is no collusion & no obstruction. I should be given apology!
Mark Morgan President Obama’s Border Patrol Chief gave the following message to me: "President Trump stay the course." I agree and believe it or not we are making great progress with a system that has been broken for many years!
China dropped the price of their currency to an almost a historic low. It’s called "currency manipulation." Are you listening Federal Reserve? This is a major violation which will greatly weaken China over time!

Will be making a decision soon on the appointment of new Chief Economic Advisor. Many people wanting the job - will choose wisely!
Oil prices getting too high. OPEC please relax and take it easy. World cannot take a price hike - fragile!
....are all coming back to the U.S. So is everyone else. We now have the best Economy in the World the envy of all. Get that big beautiful plant in Ohio open now. Close a plant in China or Mexico where you invested so heavily pre-Trump but not in the U.S.A. Bring jobs home!
NBC NEWS is wrong again! They cite "sources" which are constantly wrong. Problem is like so many others the sources probably don’t exist they are fabricated fiction! NBC my former home with the Apprentice is now as bad as Fake News CNN. Sad!
Will be interviewed tonight on @seanhannity at 9:00 P.M. @FoxNews
I will be traveling to Florida tomorrow to meet with our great Coast Guard FEMA and many of the brave first responders & others.
Ron DeSantis showed great courage in his hard fought campaign to become the Governor of Florida. Congratulations to Ron and family!
It is a stunner by any stretch of the imagination! @CNBC
So sad and unfair that the FCC wouldn’t approve the Sinclair Broadcast merger with Tribune. This would have been a great and much needed Conservative voice for and of the People. Liberal Fake News NBC and Comcast gets approved much bigger but not Sinclair. Disgraceful!
The already discredited Woodward book so many lies and phony sources has me calling Jeff Sessions "mentally retarded" and "a dumb southerner." I said NEITHER never used those terms on anyone including Jeff and being a southerner is a GREAT thing. He made this up to divide!
Iran and it’s economy is going very bad and fast! I will meet or not meet it doesn’t matter - it is up to them!
Buy American & hire American are the principles at the core of my agenda which is: JOBS JOBS JOBS! Thank you @exxonmobil.
Praying for the families of the two Iowa police who were ambushed this morning. An attack on those who keep us safe is an attack on us all.
Thank you to the great men and women of the United States @SecretService for a job well done!
Moving up News Conference to 5:15. Enjoy!
A big National Emergency vote today by The United States Senate on Border Security & the Wall (which is already under major construction). I am prepared to veto if necessary. The Southern Border is a National Security and Humanitarian Nightmare but it can be easily fixed!
Thank you to Sue Kruczek who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge for your kind words while on @foxandfriends. We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - Nick will not have died in vain!
"I’ve been doing this for 40 years and I’ve never seen anything like this (Economy)." @Varneyco @foxandfriends
14 days for $28 MILLION - $2 MILLION a day No Collusion. A great day for America!
"John Brennan no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar. Not only is he a liar he’s a liar about being a liar."  Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends
Turkey has taken advantage of the United States for many years. They are now holding our wonderful Christian Pastor who I must now ask to represent our Country as a great patriot hostage. We will pay nothing for the release of an innocent man but we are cutting back on Turkey!
Great progress being made in our Trade Negotiations with Japan. Agriculture and beef heavily in play. Much will wait until after their July elections where I anticipate big numbers!
The Navy put out a disclaimer on the McCain story. Looks like the story was an exaggeration or even Fake News - but why not everything else is!
Companies are giving big bonuses to their workers because of the Tax Cut Bill. Really great!
Tom Homan fmr ICE Director: "There is nobody that has done more for border security & public safety than President Trump. I’ve worked for six presidents and I respect them all but nobody has done more than this Administration & President Trump that’s just a stone cold fact!"
Democrats are allowing no transparency at the Witch Hunt hearings. If Republicans ever did this they would be excoriated by the Fake News. Let the facts come out from the charade of people most of whom I do not know they are interviewing for 9 hours each not selective leaks.
More apprehensions (captures)at the Southern Border than in many years. Border Patrol amazing! Country is FULL! System has been broken for many years. Democrats in Congress must agree to fix loopholes - No Open Borders (Crimes & Drugs). Will Close Southern Border If necessary...
....Lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in Russia. Put up zero money zero guarantees and didn’t do the project. Witch Hunt!
John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!
Congratulations to Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania. He will be a great Senator and will represent his people well - like they haven’t been represented in many years. Lou is a friend of mine and a special guy he will very much help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Why doesn't Fake News talk about Podesta ties to Russia as covered by @FoxNews or money from Russia to Clinton - sale of  Uranium?
White House news conference at 5:30 P.M. Eastern. Thank you!
If I didn’t demand that National Guard Troops go into Minneapolis after watching how poorly the Liberal Democrat government was handling things you wouldn’t even have a Minneapolis now. Once they were deployed in force all looting burning and crime stopped DEAD!
"Deven Nunes predicts that more examples of Mueller team misconduct will be revealed in coming weeks." @seanhannity  @FoxNews
The same people who got us into the Middle East mess are the people who most want to stay there!
Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council is right when he says on @foxandfriends that the Democrat inspired laws make it tough for us to stop people at the Border. MUST BE CHANDED but I am bringing out the military for this National Emergency. They will be stopped!
Democrats just announced that they no longer want the Whistleblower to testify. But everything was about the Whistleblower (they no longer want the second Whistleblower either) which they don’t want because the account of my call bore NO RELATIONSHIP to the call itself.....
I cannot imagine that these very fine Republican Senators would allow the American people to suffer a broken ObamaCare any longer!
"One of the biggest things to come out of Mueller’s testimony was the fact that when he was asked was there ANYTHING that impeded your investigation the answer was a clear unequivocal NO." Misty Marris  @FoxNews  True but many other great "exonerating" things came out.....
My deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those involved in the terrible boat accident which just took place in Missouri. Such a tragedy such a great loss. May God be with you all!
.....I did NOT know of the meeting with my son Don jr. Sounds to me like someone is trying to make up stories in order to get himself out of an unrelated jam (Taxi cabs maybe?). He even retained Bill and Crooked Hillary’s lawyer. Gee I wonder if they helped him make the choice!
General John Kelly is doing a fantastic job as Chief of Staff. There is tremendous spirit and talent in the W.H. Don't believe the Fake News
Congratulations to all of my many friends at The Villages in Florida on having done so well and with such great spirit during these rather unusual times. So proud of everyone! Mark Morse & Gary Lester have really stepped up to the plate. Hope to see everyone soon.
"What has happened here with the Anthony Wiener laptop the Server all of the Emails between Huma Abedin and Hillary Clinton the deleted Clinton Emails - what is going on?" @LouDobbs  Joe D & Victoria T!
Pelosi & Schumer have no interest in making a deal that is good for our Country and our People. All they want is a trillion dollars and much more for their Radical Left Governed States most of which are doing very badly. It is called a BAILOUT for many years of bad Dem Mgmt!
Under my Administration we are restoring @NASA to greatness and we are going back to the Moon then Mars. I am updating my budget to include an additional $1.6 billion so that we can return to Space in a BIG WAY!
"Collusion with Russia was very real. Hillary Clinton and her team 100% colluded with the Russians and so did Adam Schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was Russians to obtain compromising material on DJT. We also know that Hillary Clinton paid through....
...vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful and very expensive defense it provides to Germany!
The problem with agreeing to a policy on immigration is that the Democrats don't want secure bordersthey don't care about safety for U.S.A.
...This evil Anti-Semitic attack is an assault on humanity. It will take all of us working together to extract the poison of Anti-Semitism from our world. We must unite to conquer hate.
Democrats working with Republicans in Congress can fix the Asylum and other loopholes quickly. We have a major National Emergency at our Border. GET IT DONE NOW!
Looking forward to my meeting with Tim Cook of Apple. We will be talking about many things including how the U.S. has been treated unfairly for many years by many countries on trade.
..Country had to be approved by me as President & I did so without hesitation  or complaint. Quite the contrary I felt it was well deserved. I even sent Air Force One to bring his body in casket from Arizona to Washington. It was my honor to do so. Also I never called..
Tremendous amounts of money pouring into the United States. People want safety!
Brett McGurk who I do not know was appointed by President Obama in 2015. Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!
I am pleased to inform you that THE BIG FIREWORKS after many years of not having any are coming back to beautiful Mount Rushmore in South Dakota. Great work @GovKristiNoem and @SecBernhardt! #MAGA
My Administration looks forward to negotiating a large scale Trade Deal with the United Kingdom. The potential is unlimited!
.@gayletrotter  "To this day the establishment media have not admitted that they were wrong and the President was right." @FoxNews
Thank you Omarosa for your service! I wish you continued success.
Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated. China market has dropped 27% in last 4months and they are talking to us. Our market is stronger than ever and will go up dramatically when these horrible Trade Deals are successfully renegotiated. America First.......
Consumer Sentiment in the month of May is the highest in 15 years. Very nice! @FoxNews
.....Country being forced to endure a long and costly trial. Tell the people "OUT" and they must leave just as they would if they were standing on your front lawn. Hiring thousands of "judges" does not work and is not acceptable - only Country in the World that does this!
At the request of many great Americans who live in the Suburbs and others I am studying the AFFH housing regulation that is having a devastating impact on these once thriving Suburban areas. Corrupt Joe Biden wants to make them MUCH WORSE. Not fair to homeowners I may END!
Failed presidential candidate (thank you President Trump!) Carly Fiorina said she will be voting for Corrupt Joe Biden. She lost so badly to me twice in one campaign that she should be voting for Joe. No complaints!!!
Meeting with "Chuck and Nancy" today about keeping government open and working. Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes. I don’t see a deal!
...This is a level of criminality beyond the pale. This is such a grave abuse of power and authority it’s like nothing else we’ve seen in our history. This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff
.@FoxNews is at it again. So different from what they used to be during the 2016 Primaries & before - Proud Warriors! Now new Fox Polls which have always been terrible to me (they had me losing BIG to Crooked Hillary) have me down to Sleepy Joe. Even considering.....
China has openly stated that they are actively trying to impact and change our election by attacking our farmers ranchers and industrial workers because of their loyalty to me. What China does not understand is that these people are great patriots and fully understand that.....
I was very much looking forward to having a press conference just prior to leaving Argentina because we have had such great success in our dealing with various countries and their leaders at the G20....
So interesting to see all of these people I beat so badly pundits & consultants that never had a chance telling me how to run for office. Many are Republicans who should LOVE our 280 new Judges rebuilt Military 2A great V.A. Low Taxes etc. Just don’t like that I beat them!
Collusion is not a crime but that doesn’t matter because there was No Collusion (except by Crooked Hillary and the Democrats)!
In the 2016 Election I was winning by so much in Florida that Broward County which was very late with vote tabulation and probably getting ready to do a "number" couldn’t do it because not enough people live in Broward for them to falsify a victory!
"The President has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year." Thank you Charlie Kirk of Turning Points USA. Sadly the Fake Mainstream Media will NEVER talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews. We are compiling a long & beautiful list.
Congratulations to all of our Mexican friends on National Independence Day. We will be doing great things together!
Home Sales hit BEST numbers in 10 years! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
Very strong signals being sent by China once they returned home from their long trip including stops from Argentina. Not to sound naive or anything but I believe President Xi meant every word of what he said at our long and hopefully historic meeting. ALL subjects discussed!
I will be making a major statement from the @WhiteHouse upon my return to D.C. Time and date to be set.
China has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a One Billion Dollar reduction in their massive Trade Deficit with the United States. Our relationship with China has been a very good one and we look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with. We must act soon!
So much happening with the now discredited Witch Hunt. This total Hoax will be studied for years!
"People who enter the United States without our permission are illegal aliens and illegal aliens should not be treated the same as people who entered the U.S. legally." Chuck Schumer in 2009 before he went left and haywire!  @foxandfriends
So many records being set with respect to our Economy. Unemployment numbers among BEST EVER. A beautiful thing to watch!
It is the same Fake News Media that said there is "no path to victory for Trump" that is now pushing the phony Russia story. A total scam!
The Wall Street Journal Editorial states that it doesn’t want me to act in an "impulsive" manner in Afghanistan. Could somebody please explain to them that we have been there for 19 years and while soldier counts are way down now hardly impulsive. Besides the Taliban is.....
"Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats can’t put down the Impeachment match. They know they couldn’t beat him in 2016 against Hillary Clinton and they’re increasingly aware of the fact that they won’t win against him in 2020 and Impeachment is the only tool they have to get....
Henry Ford would be very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car that is far less safe and doesn’t work as well because execs don’t want to fight California regulators. Car companies should know....
Are the investigative "journalists" of the New York Times going to investigate themselves - who is the anonymous letter writer?
California Governor Jerry Brown is doing the right thing and sending the National Guard to the Border. Thank you Jerry good move for the safety of our Country!
..deferral to December. It actually helps China more than us but will be reciprocated. Millions of jobs are being lost in China to other non-Tariffed countries. Thousands of companies are leaving. Of course China wants to make a deal. Let them work humanely with Hong Kong first!
Great to see that Dr. Kelli Ward is running against Flake Jeff Flake who is WEAK on borders crime and a non-factor in Senate. He's toxic!
Hogan Gidley will be leaving the White House on July 1 and heading over to my campaign to be the National Press Secretary.  He is a strong loyal and trusted member of the team that I know will do an outstanding job! We must WIN this election! Follow him at @JHoganGidley.
The Republican Senators must step up to the plate and after 7 years vote to Repeal and Replace. Next Tax Reform and Infrastructure. WIN!
...treat our farmers much better. Highly restrictive. Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S. They have not done what needs to be done. Millions of people addicted and dying.
The #G20Summit was a wonderful success and carried out beautifully by Chancellor Angela Merkel. Thank you!
Congresswoman Maxine Waters was called the most Corrupt Member of Congress! @FoxNews If Dems win she would be put in charge of our Country’s finances. The beginning of the end!
...Yes I am currently suing various people for violating their confidentiality agreements. Disgusting and foul mouthed Omarosa is one. I gave her every break despite the fact that she was despised by everyone and she went for some cheap money from a book. Numerous others also!
....Sanctions come off Iran and they become a productive and prosperous nation again - The sooner the better!
Our Country cannot survive as a Socialist Nation and that’s what the Democrats want it to be. The USA will never become a large scale version of Venezuela. All control is already being taken away from Sleepy Joe. He has Zero to say!!!
Looks like another great day for the Stock Market. Consumer Confidence is at Record High. I guess somebody likes me (my policies)!
Will be speaking at the United Nations this morning. Our country is much stronger and much richer than it was when I took office less than two years ago. We are also MUCH safer!
Spoke yesterday with the King of Saudi Arabia about peace in the Middle-East. Interesting things are happening!
After defeating 100% of the ISIS Caliphate I largely moved our troops out of Syria. Let Syria and Assad protect the Kurds and fight Turkey for their own land. I said to my Generals why should we be fighting for Syria....
Congrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare- now it's onto the House!
E-mails show that the AmazonWashingtonPost and the FailingNewYorkTimes were reluctant to cover the Clinton/Lynch secret meeting in plane.
....and more control over Iraq and the people of Iraq are not happy with that. It will never end well!
Congratulations to Kristian Saucier a man who has served proudly in the Navy on your newly found Freedom. Now you can go out and have the life you deserve!
We are winning big time against China. Companies & jobs are fleeing. Prices to us have not gone up and in some cases have come down. China is not our problem though Hong Kong is not helping. Our problem is with the Fed. Raised too much & too fast. Now too slow to cut....
"John Solomon: As Russia Collusion fades Ukrainian plot to help Clinton emerges." @seanhannity  @FoxNews
"Three more Central Banks cut rates." Our problem is not China - We are stronger than ever money is pouring into the U.S. while China is losing companies by the thousands to other countries and their currency is under siege - Our problem is a Federal Reserve that is too.....
Just got back from Wisconsin. Great day great people!
Ainsley Earnhardt a truly great person just wrote a wonderful book "The Light Within Me" which is doing really well. She is very special and so is her new book...bring it to number one!
We are doing very well with China and talking!
Crazy Lawrence O’Donnell who has been calling me wrong from even before I announced my run for the Presidency even being previously forced by NBC to apologize which he did while crying for things he said about me & The Apprentice was again forced to apologize this time.....
I have arrived in Scotland and will be at Trump Turnberry for two days of meetings calls and hopefully some golf - my primary form of exercise! The weather is beautiful and this place is incredible! Tomorrow I go to Helsinki for a Monday meeting with Vladimir Putin.
I love reading about all of the "geniuses" who were so instrumental in my election success. Problem is most don't exist. #Fake News! MAGA
The United States was supposed to be in Syria for 30 days that was many years ago. We stayed and got deeper and deeper into battle with no aim in sight. When I arrived in Washington ISIS was running rampant in the area. We quickly defeated 100% of the ISIS Caliphate.....
Great night for Republicans! Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California. He can win. Even Fake News CNN said the Trump impact was really big much bigger than they ever thought possible. So much for the big Blue Wave it may be a big Red Wave. Working hard!
Nervous Nancy Pelosi & the Democrat House are getting nothing done. Perhaps they could lead the way with the USMCA the spectacular & very popular new Trade Deal that replaces NAFTA the worst Trade Deal in the history of the U.S.A. Great for our Farmers Manufacturers & Unions!
....brought up not them) because the Dems won’t change the Loopholes and Asylum. Big Media Con Job!
.@FoxNews allows more negative ads on me than practically all of the other networks combined. Not like the old days but we will win even bigger than 2016. Roger Ailes was the GREATEST!
But while Dallas dropped to its knees as a team they all stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made-we all love our country!
.And to think that just last week he was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women. Lesley Stahl tape?
Federal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that "President Trump has the right to end DACA." President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem and didn’t. I am waiting for the Dems they are running for the hills!
"Trump has outmastered the Deep State. He’s light years ahead of us." MSDNC. I disagree. We have a long way to go. There are still some very bad sick people in our government - people who do not love our Country (In fact they hate our Country!).
Shifty Adam Schiff wants to rest his entire case on a Whistleblower who he now says can’t testify & the reason he can’t testify is that he is afraid to do so because his account of the Presidential telephone call is a fraud & totally different from the actual transcribed call...
About the only way a person is able to write a book on me is if they agree that it will contain as much bad "stuff" as possible much of which is lies. It’s like getting a job with CNN or MSDNC and saying that "President Trump is great." You have ZERO chance. FAKE NEWS!
Hard to believe that with thousands of people from South of the Border walking unimpeded toward our country in the form of large Caravans that the Democrats won’t approve legislation that will allow laws for the protection of our country. Great Midterm issue for Republicans!
While Washington Michigan was a big success Washington D.C. just didn’t work. Everyone is talking about the fact that the White House Correspondents Dinner was a very big boring bust...the so-called comedian really "bombed." @greggutfeld should host next year! @PeteHegseth
Over the course of the past two days the United States and China have held candid and constructive conversations on the status of the trade relationship between both countries. The relationship between President Xi and myself remains a very strong one and conversations....
Stock Market at new all-time high! Working on new trade deals that will be great for U.S. and its workers!
...have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia..just excuse for losing. The only Collusion was that done by the DNC the Democrats and Crooked Hillary. The writer of the story Maggie Haberman a Hillary flunky knows nothing about me and is not given access.
Hopefully OPEC will be keeping oil flows as is not restricted. The World does not want to see or need higher oil prices!
Iran has become so unstable that the regime has shut down their entire Internet System so that the Great Iranian people cannot talk about the tremendous violence taking place within the country....
"Gas prices drop across the United States because President Trump has deregulated Energy and we are now  producing a great deal more oil than ever before." @foxandfriends  But this is bad news for Russia why would President Trump do such a thing? Thought he worked for Kremlin?
.....who is being totally protected by his best friend Bob Mueller & the 13 Angry Democrats - leaking machines who have NO interest in going after the Real Collusion (and much more) by Crooked Hillary Clinton her Campaign and the Democratic National Committee. Just Watch!
CHANGE THE LAWS!
U.S. Embassy opening in Jerusalem will be covered live on @FoxNews & @FoxBusiness. Lead up to 9:00 A.M. (eastern) event has already begun. A great day for Israel!
The so-called Whistleblower before knowing I was going to release the exact Transcript stated that my call with the Ukrainian President was "crazy frightening and completely lacking in substance related to national security." This is a very big Lie. Read the Transcript!
....The President Obama quote just before election. That’s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to "rock the boat." When I easily won the Electoral College the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.
It has been two years since the tragedy in Parkland. We will always mourn the innocent lives taken from us – 14 wonderful students and 3 terrific educators. Earlier this week I met with families whose experiences from that horrible day still pierce the soul....
The reason for the China pullback & attempted renegotiation of the Trade Deal is the sincere HOPE that they will be able to "negotiate" with Joe Biden or one of the very weak Democrats and thereby continue to ripoff the United States (($500 Billion a year)) for years to come....
...There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed. Should move fast. DEATH PENALTY!
"Just another abuse of power in a long series of abuses of power by the Democrats that began during the Obama Administration continued through the Mueller FBI operation & now the baton has been passed to Jerry Nadler to continue to abuse power to harass President Trump..
So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill. Everyone is talking really nice to see!
The failing @nytimes writes false story after false story about me. They don't even call to verify the facts of a story. A Fake News Joke!
The Ukraine investigation is just as Corrupt and Fake as all of the other garbage that went on before it. Even Shifty Schiff got caught cheating when he made up what I said on the call!
Just returned from Asia after 12 very successful days. Great to be home!
Weather looking good clearing rapidly and temperatures going down fast. See you in 45 minutes 6:30 to 7:00 P.M. at Lincoln Memorial!
The Whistleblower’s complaint is completely different and at odds from my actual conversation with the new President of Ukraine. The so-called "Whistleblower" knew practically NOTHING in that those ridiculous charges were far more dramatic & wrong just like Liddle’ Adam Schiff..
In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job!
.@BrianKempGA ran a great race in Georgia – he won. It is time to move on!
....Different opinions are expressed and I make a decisive and final decision - it is a very simple process. All sides views and policies are covered. I’m sure that Iran will want to talk soon.
Really pathetic how @FoxNews is trying to be so politically correct by loading the airwaves with Democrats like Chris Van Hollen the no name Senator from Maryland. He has been on forever playing up the Impeachment Hoax. Dems wouldn’t even give Fox their low ratings debates....
...They should realize that these relationships are a good thing not a bad thing. The U.S. is being respected again. Watch Trade!
Brad Blakeman: "The American people understand that we have been played by foreign actors who would rather have us fight their battles for them. The President says look this is your neighborhood you’ve got to stand up to protect yourselves. Don’t always look to America."
From day one Rick Scott never wavered. He was a great Governor and will be even a greater Senator in representing the People of Florida. Congratulations to Rick on having waged such a courageous and successful campaign!
....Donald Trump and now we find out that there wasn’t even a hearing - that Donald Trump’s 4th Amendment right to privacy was signed away...and someone in there is swearing that this stuff is true when it wasn’t? This is the scandal here - a police state."  Dan Bongino
We will be guided by the wishes of Prime Minister Abe of Japan a great friend of the United States and a man who has done a magnificent job on the Olympic Venue as to attending the Olympic Games in Japan. He will make the proper decision!
....of the tremendous ground we have lost to China on Trade since the ridiculous one sided formation of the WTO. It will all happen and much faster than people think!
I love Canada but they’ve taken advantage of our Country for many years!
These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA. They want in on the act!
I can’t think of something more concerning than a law enforcement officer suggesting that their going to use their powers to affect an election!" Inspector General Horowitz on what was going on with numerous people regarding my election. A Rigged Witch Hunt!p
"This ridiculous Impeachment is a travesty it’s not an inquiry. Just read the transcript." @LouDobbs
Based on the attack on Saudi Arabia which may have an impact on oil prices I have authorized the release of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve if needed in a to-be-determined amount....
Chuck Schumer said "the Summit was what the Texans call all cattle and no hat." Thank you Chuck but are you sure you got that right? No more nuclear testing or rockets flying all over the place blew up launch sites. Hostages already back hero remains coming home & much more!
My team is closely monitoring the flooding in Central Michigan – Stay SAFE and listen to local officials. Our brave First Responders are once again stepping up to serve their fellow citizens THANK YOU!
The Dems want to stop tax cuts good healthcare and Border Security.Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in P's. Vote now for Karen H
Russian Collusion with the Trump Campaign one of the most successful in history is a TOTAL HOAX. The Democrats paid for the phony and discredited Dossier which was along with Comey McCabe Strzok and his lover the lovely Lisa Page used to begin the Witch Hunt. Disgraceful!
The Republicans House members were fantastic yesterday. It always helps to have a much better case in fact the Dems have no case at all but the unity & sheer brilliance of these Republican warriors all of them was a beautiful sight to see. Dems had no answers and wanted out!
Watching the events unfolding in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania. Law enforcement on the scene. People in Squirrel Hill area should remain sheltered. Looks like multiple fatalities. Beware of active shooter. God Bless All!
Looking forward to a big rally in Nashville Tennessee tonight. Big crowd of great people expected. Will be fun!
....them happy or even a little bit satisfied. They were RUDE and NASTY. This is their political playbook and they will use it right up to the election on November 3rd. They will not change because they feel that this is the only way they can win. America will not be fooled!!!

West Virginia was incredible last night. Crowds and enthusiasm were beyond GDP at 3% wow!Dem Governor became a Republican last night.
Pastor Andrew Brunson a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason. They call him a Spy but I am more a Spy than he is. Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs!
Congratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night. Wow 69-30 those are big numbers. Now go win against the open border crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you. She is weak on Vets the Military and the 2nd Amendment. Win!
The Democrats OBSTRUCTION of the desperately needed Wall where they almost all recently agreed it should be built is exceeded only by their OBSTRUCTION of 350 great people wanting & expecting to come into Government after being delayed for more than two years a U.S. record!
Major rescue operations underway!
.@Rasmussen_Poll just came out at 48% approval rate despite the constant and intense Fake News. Higher than Election Day and higher than President Obama. Rasmussen was one of the most accurate Election Day polls!
Just watched Wacky Tom Steyer who I have not seen in action before be interviewed by @jaketapper. He comes off as a crazed & stumbling lunatic who should be running out of money pretty soon. As bad as their field is if he is running for President the Dems will eat him alive!
"The Obama people did something that’s never been done...They spied on a rival presidential campaign. Would it be OK if Trump did it next? I am losing faith that our system is on the level. I’m beginning to think it is rotten & corrupt. Scary stuff Obama did." @TuckerCarlson  DOJ
....I can’t imagine any President having a better or closer relationship with their Vice President then the two of us. Just more FAKE NEWS the Enemy of the People!
....and ruined. The Federal Government must again seek the Death Penalty in a do-over of that chapter of the original trial. Our Country cannot let the appellate decision stand. Also it is ridiculous that this process is taking so long!
General Anthony Tata: "President Trump is a man of his word & he said he was going to be tough on the Border and he is tough on the Border. He has rightfully strengthened the Border in the face of an unprecedented threat. It’s the right move by President Trump." Thanks General!
Ohio vote today for Troy Balderson for Congress. His opponent controlled by Nancy Pelosi is weak on Crime the Border Military Vets your 2nd Amendment - and will end your Tax Cuts. Troy will be a great Congressman. #MAGA
It is my pleasure to announce that @StephenMoore a very respected Economist will be nominated to serve on the Fed Board. I have known Steve for a long time – and have no doubt he will be an outstanding choice!
All in for Senator Steve Daines as he proposes an Amendment for a strong BAN on burning our American Flag. A no brainer!
President Trump’s Approval Rating on Economy is at 52% a 4 point jump. Fox Poll @foxandfriends  Shouldn’t this be at 100%? Best stock market economy and unemployment numbers ever! Most people working within U.S. ever! Low interest rates very low inflation! Country doing great!
"45 year low in illegal immigration this year." @foxandfriends
Jeff Flake(y) doesn’t want to protect the Non-Senate confirmed Special Counsel he wants to protect his future after being unelectable in Arizona for the "crime" of doing a terrible job! A weak and ineffective guy!
China Iran & other foreign countries are looking at the Democrat Candidates and "drooling" over the small prospect that they could be dealing with them in the not too distant future. They would be able to rip off our beloved USA like never before. With President Trump NO WAY!
Health Insurance stocks which have gone through the roof during the ObamaCare years plunged yesterday after I ended their Dems windfall!
So funny to watch Little Donny Deutsch on TV with his own failing show. When I did The Apprentice Donny would call me (along with @ErinBurnett & others) and BEG to be on that VERY successful show. He had the TV "bug" & I would let him come on though he (& Erin) had very little..
"Day after day really good news on the economy. By the way this didn’t just happen by accident it’s the result of a lot of the policies that Donald Trump has put into place. Obviously the Tax Cut and now we have these two BIG trade deals." @StephenMoore  Great future growth!
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!
....drug prices pre-existing conditions and our great Vets. All they are geared up to do six committees is squander time day after day trying to find anything which will be bad for me. A pure fishing expedition like this never happened before & it should never happen again!
Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy "up to 400 National Guard Troops" to do nothing. The crime rate in California is high enough and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown’s charade. We need border security and action not words!
"Project Veritas-Obtained Undercover Videos Highlight Jeff Zucker’s (@CNN) Campaign To Destroy Trump. Videos Reveal @CNN’s BIAS!" @TuckerCarlson @FoxNews Does this sound like a good or even great lawsuit?
Many @harleydavidson owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas. Great! Most other companies are coming in our direction including Harley competitors. A really bad move! U.S. will soon have a level playing field or better.
Based on the Tariffs and Trade Barriers long placed on the U.S. & its great companies and workers by the European Union if these Tariffs and Barriers are not soon broken down and removed we will be placing a 20% Tariff on all of their cars coming into the U.S. Build them here!
Democrats don’t care about Border Security. They refuse to give the votes necessary to fix the Loopholes and Asylum. Would be so easy! They want Open Borders which means CRIMECRIMECRIME!
Watching @FoxNews weekend anchors is worse than watching low ratings Fake News @CNN or Lyin’ Brian Williams (remember when he totally fabricated a War Story trying to make himself into a hero & got fired. A very dishonest journalist!) and the crew of degenerate......
....Absentee Ballots are fine because you have to go through a precise process to get your voting privilege. Not so with Mail-Ins. Rigged Election!!! 20% fraudulent ballots?
As I have always said let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!
I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy. Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer. Many billions of dollars. P.O. leaders don’t have a clue (or do they?)!
.@FoxNews  Poll numbers plummet on the Democrat inspired and paid for Russian Witch Hunt. With all of the bias lying and hate by the investigators people want the investigators investigated. Much more will come out. A total scam and excuse for the Dems losing the Election!
The Democrats want MASSIVE tax increases & soft crime producing borders.The Republicans want the biggest tax cut in history & the WALL!
Will be having a Labor Day News Conference today at the White House 1:00 P.M. Jobs number and the Economic comeback are looking GREAT. Happy Labor Day!

The White House Press Conference will take place today at 1:00 P.M. recognizing that it is Good Friday!
Why was the FBI’s sick loser Peter Strzok working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover lawyer Lisa Page that "we’ll stop" Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt!
"Ford has abruptly killed a plan to sell a Chinese-made small vehicle in the U.S. because of the prospect of higher U.S. Tariffs." CNBC.  This is just the beginning. This car can now be BUILT IN THE U.S.A. and Ford will pay no tariffs!
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country!
Will be interviewed by @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. on @FoxNews. Enjoy!!!
....United States Citizens first. Border Patrol and others in Law Enforcement have been doing a great job. We said there was a Crisis - the Fake News & the Dems said it was "manufactured." Now all agree we were right but they always knew that. They are crowded (which we.....
When all of the people pushing so hard for Criminal Justice Reform were  unable to come even close to getting it done they came to me as a group and asked for my help. I got it done with a group of Senators & others who would never have gone for it. Obama couldn’t come close....
Nadler just said that I "pressured Ukraine to interfere in our 2020 Election." Ridiculous and he knows that is not true. Both the President & Foreign Minister of Ukraine said many times that there "WAS NO PRESSURE." Nadler and the Dems know this but refuse to acknowledge!
"There is no Collusion. All of these investigations are in search of a crime. Democrats have no evidence to impeach President Trump. Ridiculous!" @DevinNunes @FoxNews
"New Polls Say Most Americans Oppose Impeachment." @foxandfriends  I did nothing wrong. This will be the first Impeachment ever where there was no crime. They don’t even allege a crime. Crazy!
ObamaCare is dead and the Democrats are obstructionists no ideas or votes only obstruction. It is solely up to the 52 Republican Senators!
Played golf today with Prime Minister Abe of Japan and @TheBig_Easy Ernie Els and had a great time. Japan is very well represented!
...despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair. Prior to its violation by Ms. Clifford and her attorney this was a private agreement. Money from the campaign or campaign contributions played no roll in this transaction.
Biden Underperforming! @OANN What else is new the story of his life.
The Failing @nytimes quotes "a senior White House official" who doesn’t exist as saying "even if the meeting were reinstated holding it on June 12 would be impossible given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed." WRONG AGAIN! Use real people not phony sources.
"46% of Americans think the Media is inventing stories about Trump & his Administration." @FoxNews   It is actually much worse than this!
John Kelly didn’t know I was going to fire James Mattis nor did he have any knowledge of my asking for a letter of resignation. Why would I tell him he was not...
....However if for any reason Mexico stops apprehending and bringing the illegals back to where they came from the U.S. will be forced to Tariff at 25% all cars made in Mexico and shipped over the Border to us. If that doesn’t work which it will I will close the Border.......
Thank you to @LOUDOBBS for giving the first six months of the Trump Administration an A+. S.C.reg cuttingStock M jobsborder etc. = TRUE!
Rod Blagojevich did not sell the Senate seat. He served 8 years in prison with many remaining. He paid a big price. Another Comey and gang deal! Thank you to @LisaMarieBoothe who really "gets" what’s going on! @FoxNews
To protect our Country we must protect American Steel! #AMERICA FIRST
The Federal Reserve is derelict in its duties if it doesn’t lower the Rate and even ideally stimulate. Take a look around the World at our competitors. Germany and others are  actually GETTING PAID to borrow money. Fed was way too fast to raise and way too slow to cut!
....Hawaii in a big fully loaded 747 to play. What did that do to the so-called Carbon Footprint? He also played moments after the brutal killing by ISIS of a wonderful young man. Totally inappropriate - and it was me who shattered 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. I was left a MESS!
The Woodward book has already been refuted and discredited by General (Secretary of Defense) James Mattis and General (Chief of Staff) John Kelly. Their quotes were made up frauds a con on the public. Likewise other stories and quotes. Woodward is a Dem operative? Notice timing?
I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election. He vehemently denied it. I've already given my opinion.....
The Russian Witch Hunt is Rigged!
I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don't watch anymore). Then how come low I.Q. Crazy Mika along with Psycho Joe came..
We are either going to have a REAL DEAL with China or no deal at all - at which point we will be charging major Tariffs against Chinese product being shipped into the United States. Ultimately I believe we will be making a deal - either now or into the future....
General Motors is very counter to what other auto and other companies are doing. Big Steel is opening and renovating plants all over the country. Auto companies are pouring into the U.S. including BMW which just announced a major new plant. The U.S.A. is booming!
Going to Dallas (the GREAT State of Texas) today. Leaving soon!
This whole Russia Probe is Rigged. Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven’t been lost in decades. 13 Angry Democrats and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years. #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST!
2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare. It is in a death spiral. Obstructionist Democrats gave up have no answer = resist!
...and they knew exactly what I said and meant. They just wanted a story. FAKE NEWS!
The Governor of California @GavinNewsom has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met that he must "clean" his forest floors regardless of what his bosses the environmentalists DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers.....
Will be leaving for Missouri soon for a speech on tax cuts and tax reform - so badly needed!
Republicans have a last chance to do the right thing on Repeal & Replace after years of talking & campaigning on it.
Bob Corker who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee is now fighting Tax Cuts....

"The Democrats can’t come to grips with the fact that there was No Collusion there was No Conspiracy there was No Obstruction. What we should be focused on is what’s been going on in our government at the highest levels of the FBI...." Senator Josh Hawley
The Fake Media (not Real Media) has gotten even worse since the election. Every story is badly slanted. We have to hold them to the truth!
As most people are aware according to the Polls I won EVERY debate including the three with Crooked Hillary Clinton despite the fact that in the first debate they modulated the sound on me and got caught. This crew looks somewhat easier than Crooked but you never know?
....the captured ISIS fighters and families. The U.S. has done far more than anyone could have ever expected including the capture of 100% of the ISIS Caliphate. It is time now for others in the region some of great wealth to protect their own territory. THE USA IS GREAT!
The Democrats have become nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS they have no policies or ideas. All they do is delay and complain.They own ObamaCare!
I look very much forward to debating whoever the lucky person is who stumbles across the finish line in the little watched Do Nothing Democrat Debates. My record is so good on the Economy and all else including debating that perhaps I would consider more than 3 debates.....
Why aren’t the Democrats in the House calling Comey Brennan Clapper Page and her FBI lover (whose invaluable phone records were illegally deleted) Crooked Hillary Podesta Ohr (and Nellie) the GPS Fusion characters Christopher Steele the DNC (& their missing server)....
"Serial killers get more Due Process than the Democrats give to the President of the United States." @marklevinshow
"FBI texts have revealed anti-Trump Bias." @FoxNews  Big News but the Fake News doesn’t want to cover. Total corruption - the Witch Hunt has turned out to be a scam! At some point soon the Mainstream Media will have to cover correctly too big a story!
Harley-Davidson should stay 100% in America with the people that got you your success. I’ve done so much for you and then this. Other companies are coming back where they belong! We won’t forget and neither will your customers or your now very HAPPY competitors!

"The lesser of two Socialists is still a Socialist!" Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana
The Failing and Corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at "1000 people" when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin’. This is the way they demean and disparage. They are very dishonest people who don’t "get" me and never did!
Kevin Corke @FoxNews "Don’t forget Michael Cohen has already been convicted of perjury and fraud and as recently as this week the Wall Street Journal has suggested that he may have stolen tens of thousands of dollars...."  Lying to reduce his jail time! Watch father-in-law!
I never offered Pardons to Homeland Security Officials never ordered anyone to close our Southern Border (although I have the absolute right to do so and may if Mexico does not apprehend the illegals coming to our Border) and am not "frustrated." It is all Fake & Corrupt News!
Congratulations to @RonnyJackson4TX on a big win against a tough and really good opponent. Ronny will be a fantastic Congressman - Will represent the wonderful people of the Great State of Texas and the USA very well. Proud of you Ronny!!!
The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST. Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. SO ILLEGAL!
I always felt I would be running and winning against Bernie Sanders not Crooked H without cheating I was right.
Told that @NYCMayor Bill de Blasio wants to paint the fabled & beautiful Fifth Avenue right in front of Trump Tower/Tiffany with a big yellow Black Lives Matter sign. "Pigs in a Blanket Fry ‘Em Like Bacon" referring to killing Police is their chant. NYC Police are furious!
My thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in DuPont Washington. Thank you to all of our wonderful First Responders who are on the scene. We are currently monitoring here at the White House.
A great deal of good things happening for our country. Jobs and Stock Market at all time highs and I believe will be getting even better!
The local politicians who run Washington D.C. (poorly) know a windfall when they see it. When asked to give us a price for holding a great celebratory military parade they wanted a number so ridiculously high that I cancelled it. Never let someone hold you up! I will instead...
Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin. Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved!
Had a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China. We will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan. Our respective teams will begin talks prior to our meeting.
France honors a great hero. Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS related terror attack. So much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical Islamic terrorism. Even stronger measures needed especially at borders!
Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit    so that election hacking & many other negative things will be guarded..
....3 months and if I waited 3 years they would do their usual "hit" pieces anyway. They are sick with hatred and dishonesty. They are truly deranged! They don’t mention Sleepy Joe’s poor work ethic  or all of the time Obama spent on the golf course often flying to....
The Fake News Media wants to stay as far away as possible from the Ukraine and China deals made by the Bidens. A Corrupt Media is so bad for our Country! In actuality the Media may be even more Corrupt than the Bidens which is hard to do!
Dr. Taylor Marshall author. "There Is A War On Christianity".  @OANN
...Trump/Russia story was an excuse used by the Democrats as justification for losing the election. Perhaps Trump just ran a great campaign?
"Face It You Probably Got A Tax Cut!" This was a New York Times headline and it is very true. If Republicans take back the House and keep the Senate and Presidency one of our first acts will be to approve a major middle income Tax Cut! Democrats only want to raise your taxes!
Yesterday was the Radical Left Democrats big Impeachment day. They worked so hard to make it something really big and special but had one problem - almost nobody showed up. "The Media admits low turnout for anti-Trump rallies." @FoxNews  "All around the Country people are.......
....looking for trouble. They are enjoying ruining people’s lives and REFUSE to look at the real corruption on the Democrat side - the lies the firings the deleted Emails and soooo much more! Mueller’s Angry Dems are looking to impact the election. They are a National Disgrace!
.....news is that at the end of 6 years after America has been made GREAT again and I leave the beautiful White House (do you think the people would demand that I stay longer? KEEP AMERICA GREAT) both of these horrible papers will quickly go out of business & be forever gone!
The prospect of Presidential Harassment by the Dems is causing the Stock Market big headaches!
New Strzok-Page texts reveal "Media Leak Strategy."  @FoxNews  So terrible and NOTHING is being done at DOJ or FBI - but the world is watching and they get it completely.
Paul Krugman of the Fake News New York Times has lost all credibility as has the Times itself with his false and highly inaccurate writings on me. He is obsessed with hatred just as others are obsessed with how stupid he is. He said Market would crash Only Record Highs!
China is targeting our farmers who they know I love & respect as a way of getting me to continue allowing them to take advantage of the U.S. They are being vicious in what will be their failed attempt. We were being nice - until now! China made $517 Billion on us last year.

People have no idea how hard Hurricane Michael has hit the great state of Georgia. I will be visiting both Florida and Georgia early next week. We are working very hard on every area and every state that was hit - we are with you!
The real story turns out to be SURVEILLANCE and LEAKING! Find the leakers.
Scaramucci who like so many others had nothing to do with my Election victory is only upset that I didn’t want him back in the Administration (where he desperately wanted to be). Also I seldom had time to return his many calls to me. He just wanted to be on TV!
We are in the NAFTA (worst trade deal ever made) renegotiation process with Mexico & Canada.Both being very difficultmay have to terminate?
....More and more states want to do this but their governors and leaders don’t have the courage to do so. The politics will soon mandate however because people from California & all over the land are demanding that Sanctuary Cities be GONE. No illegals Drugs or Trafficking!
Just returned from Europe. Trip was a great success for America. Hard work but big results!
The Economy is about ready to go through the roof. Stock Market ready to break ALL-TIME RECORD. 401k’s incredible. New Jobs Record. Remember all of this when you VOTE. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your Taxes. Depression!!! Don’t let it happen! #MAGA
Business is looking better than ever with business enthusiasm at record levels. Stock Market at an all-time high. That doesn't just happen!

Congratulations to Danny Tarkanian on his big GOP primary win in Nevada. Danny worked hard an got a great result. Looking good in November!
The Unsolicited Mail In Ballot Scam is a major threat to our Democracy & the Democrats know it. Almost all recent elections using this system even though much smaller &  with far fewer Ballots to count have ended up being a disaster. Large numbers of missing Ballots & Fraud!
Republicans are totally deprived of their rights in this Impeachment Witch Hunt. No lawyers no questions no transparency! The good news is that the Radical Left Dems have No Case. It is all based on their Fraud and Fabrication!

So great that John McCain is coming back to vote. Brave - American hero! Thank you John.
....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more) which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team. Besides there was NO COLLUSION with Russia except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems!

A far left magazine or very "progressive" as some would call it which has been doing poorly and hasn’t been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years Christianity Today knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would rather.....
Most of the money raised by the RINO losers of the so-called "Lincoln Project" goes into their own pockets. With what I’ve done on Judges Taxes Regulations Healthcare the Military Vets (Choice!) & protecting our great 2A they should love Trump. Problem is I BEAT THEM ALL!
Our Country was built on Tariffs and Tariffs are now leading us to great new Trade Deals - as opposed to the horrible and unfair Trade Deals that I inherited as your President. Other Countries should not be allowed to come in and steal the wealth of our great U.S.A. No longer!
Billions of additional dollars are being spent by NATO countries since my visit last year at my request but it isn’t nearly enough. U.S. spends too much. Europe’s borders are BAD! Pipeline dollars to Russia are not acceptable!
Ralph Norman ran a fantastic race to win in the Great State of South Carolina's 5th District. We are all honored by your success tonight!
With Spies or "Informants" as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not) all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or "Justice" contact me to tell me of the  phony Russia problem?
Loved being on @foxandfriends this morning. Great show!
Wow just revealed that Michael Cohen wrote a "love letter to Trump" manuscript for a new book that he was pushing. Written and submitted long after Charlottesville and Helsinki his phony reasons for going rogue. Book is exact opposite of his fake testimony which now is a lie!
"What’s been revealed is a Country in better shape than it’s been in decades. Working men and women in the Country are the beneficiaries of a President who’s doing exactly what he said he was going to do that is to restore prosperity for all Americans." @LouDobbs  Thank you Lou!
Lou Dobbs: "This cannot go forward...this Special Counsel with all of his conflicts with his 17 Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia. The Dems are the ones who should be investigated." Thank you Lou so true!

What about all of the contact with the Clinton campaign and the Russians? Also is it true that the DNC would not let the FBI in to look?
The Do Nothing Radical Left Democrats have just announced that they are going to seek to Impeach me over NOTHING. They already gave up on the ridiculous Mueller "stuff" so now they hang their hats on two totally appropriate (perfect) phone calls with the Ukrainian President....
How much longer will the failing nytimes with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources) remain in business?
So funny to watch Fake News Networks among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased. Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC which is a total joke.
We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada. NAFTA which is under renegotiation right now has been a bad deal for U.S.A. Massive relocation of companies & jobs. Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also Canada must..

Hurricane Irma is raging but we have great teams of talented and brave people already in place and ready to help. Be careful be safe! #FEMA
Things are going along very well with China. They are paying us Tens of Billions of Dollars made possible by their monetary devaluations and pumping in massive amounts of cash to keep their system going. So far our consumer is paying nothing - and no inflation. No help from Fed!
So interesting that when I announced Trump National Doral in Miami would be used for the hosting of the G-7 and then rescinded due to Do Nothing Democrat/Fake News Anger very few in Media mentioned that NO PROFITS would be taken or would be given FREE if legally permissible!

Farmers have not been doing well for 15 years. Mexico Canada China and others have treated them unfairly. By the time I finish trade talks that will change. Big trade barriers against U.S. farmers and other businesses will finally be broken. Massive trade deficits no longer!
....Remember NAFTA was one of the WORST Trade Deals ever made. The U.S. lost thousands of businesses and millions of jobs. We were far better off before NAFTA - should never have been signed. Even the Vat Tax was not accounted for. We make new deal or go back to pre-NAFTA!
"In my opinion the President has done more good on the Korean issue in the last year and a half than President Obama did in eight years. If you look at the strides they made during the Obama years which advocated strategic patience-they stuck their head in the sand. This is.....

The Failing New York Times did something I have never seen done before. They used the concept of "time value of money" in doing a very old boring and often told hit piece on me. Added up this means that 97% of their stories on me are bad. Never recovered from bad election call!
"After many years the United States is finally waking up to Beijing’s plans and ambitions to pass us as the dominant economic & military superpower in the 21st Century. What’s happening now is that the U.S. is finally responding (thank you President Trump). This is taking.....

Such a fantastic win for Ron DeSantis and the people of the Great State of Florida. Ron will be a fantastic Governor. On to November!
The Democrats whose votes we need in the Senate will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED. If the Dems vote no there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don’t want Open Borders and Crime!
I was right about Comey CROOKED COP!
Nancy Pelosi just said that she is interested in lowering prescription drug prices & working on the desperately needed USMCA. She is incapable of working on either. It is just camouflage for trying to win an election through impeachment. The Do Nothing Democrats are stuck in mud!
Democrats slam GOP healthcare proposal as Obamacare premiums & deductibles increase by over 100%. Remember keep your doctor keep your plan?
NASA which is making a BIG comeback under the Trump Administration has just named 9 astronauts for Boeing and Spacex space flights. We have the greatest facilities in the world and we are now letting the private sector pay to use them. Exciting things happening. Space Force!

Democrats must apologize to USA: Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said that "United States Ambassador Gordon Sondland did NOT link financial military assistance to a request for Ukraine to open up an investigation into former V.P. Joe Biden & his son Hunter Biden.....
Just like Schiff fabricated my phone call he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing!

@CNN @MSNBC Whether we are Republican or Democrat we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks!
The Wall is under construction and moving along quickly despite all of the Radical Liberal Democrat lawsuits. What are they thinking as our Country is invaded by so many people (illegals) and things (Drugs) that we do not want. Make America Great Again!
Michaels Cohen’s attorney clarified the record saying his client does not know if President Trump knew about the Trump Tower meeting (out of which came nothing!). The answer is that I did NOT know about the meeting. Just another phony story by the Fake News Media!
Today’s shooting in El Paso Texas was not only tragic it was an act of cowardice. I know that I stand with everyone in this Country to condemn today’s hateful act. There are no reasons or excuses that will ever justify killing innocent people....

The Stock Market hit another Record High yesterday number 133 in less than three years as your all time favorite President and the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats want to impeach me. Don’t worry I have done nothing wrong. Actually they have!
John James running as a Republican for the Senate from Michigan is a spectacular young star of the future. We should make him a star of the present. A distinguished West Point Grad and Vet people should Vote Out Schumer Puppet Debbie Stabenow who does nothing for Michigan!
"Former FBI Director James Comey under fire for his testimony acknowledging he knew that the Democrats paid for that phony Trump Dossier." @LouDobbs  Details on Tuesday night.
Bad lawyer and fraudster Michael Cohen said under sworn testimony that he never asked for a Pardon. His lawyers totally contradicted him. He lied! Additionally he directly asked me for a pardon. I said NO. He lied again! He also badly wanted to work at the White House. He lied!
If Republican Senate doesn't get rid of the Filibuster Rule & go to a simple majority which the Dems would do they are just wasting time!
I am in Brussels but always thinking about our farmers. Soy beans fell 50% from 2012 to my election. Farmers have done poorly for 15 years. Other countries’ trade barriers and tariffs have been destroying their businesses. I will open...
Our great Economy is the talk of everyone!
Our Southern Border is under siege. Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws. Must build a Wall. Mexico which has a massive crime problem is doing little to help!
With almost no inflation our Country is needlessly being forced to pay a MUCH higher interest rate than other countries only because of a very misguided Federal Reserve. In addition Quantitative Tightening is continuing making it harder for our Country to compete. As good.....

Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives. We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U.S. trade wins!
Crazy chaotic Democrat Debate last night. Fake News said Biden did well even though he said half of our population was shot to death. Would be OVER for most. Mini Mike was weak and unsteady but helped greatly by his many commercials (which are not supposed to be allowed....

....Tariffs will make our country much richer than it is today. Only fools would disagree. We are using them to negotiate fair trade deals and if countries are still unwilling to negotiate they will pay us vast sums of money in the form of Tariffs. We win either way......
Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK neo-Nazis & white supremacists......
....I am very happy for Eddie Gallagher and his family!
Mini Mike Bloomberg after making a total fool of himself as he got badly beaten up by Pocahontas and the Democrats in the Primaries is at it again. He tried to buy an Election and went away with a major case of Depression. Now he’s throwing money at the Dems looking for a job!
Illegal immigration is a top National Security problem. After decades of playing games with the whole World laughing at the stupidity of our immigration laws and with Democrats thinking...

Congratulations to Emmanuel Macron on his big win today as the next President of France. I look very much forward to working with him!
The Dems are getting NOTHING done in Congress! They only want a Do-Over on Mueller!
Breaking News @MSNBC: "Cohen’s lawyer contradicts Cohen’s testimony about never seeking a Presidential Pardon."
Record Stock Market & Jobs!
All the Do Nothing Democrats are focused on is Impeaching the President for having a very good conversation with the Ukrainian President. I knew that many people were listening even have a transcript. They have been at this "stuff" from the day I got elected. Bad for Country!
Despite requests I have no plans to meet Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Maybe someday in the future. I am sure he is an absolutely lovely man!
I have been asking Director Comey & others from the beginning of my administration to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community.....
....Governor of the State did a good  job. That may be true but she could not have done it without the tremendous economic success of our Country & the turnaround that my Administration has caused. Really Nasty to me in his average I.Q. Columns kissed my a.. on the call. Phony!
China is DREAMING that Sleepy Joe Biden or any of the others gets elected in 2020. They LOVE ripping off America!
The radical left lawyers want the FBI to get involved NOW. Why didn’t someone call the FBI 36 years ago?
...really bad things. Nasty to people & would constantly miss meetings & work. When Gen. Kelly came on board he told me she was a loser & nothing but problems. I told him to try working it out if possible because she only said GREAT things about me - until she got fired!
.@foxandfriends  Dems are taking forever to approve my people including Ambassadors. They are nothing but OBSTRUCTIONISTS! Want approvals.
Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals. He says that if he loses (he really means when!) in the primaries he will spend money helping whoever the Democrat nominee is. By doing this he figures they won’t hit him as hard....
The HISTORIC Rescissions Package we’ve proposed would cut $15000000000 in Wasteful Spending! We are getting our government back on track.
The Democrats will make a deal with me on healthcare as soon as ObamaCare folds - not long. Do not worry we are in very  good shape!
Congratulations to @foxandfriends on being named BY FAR the Number One Rated cable news show. CNN and MSNBC have totally tanked their ratings are terrible. They have zero credibility!
The only people who don’t like the Tax Cut Bill are the people that don’t understand it or the Obstructionist Democrats that know how really good it is and do not want the credit and success to go to the Republicans!
Big success on the Turkey/Syria Border. Safe Zone created! Ceasefire has held and combat missions have ended. Kurds are safe and have worked very nicely with us. Captured ISIS prisoners secured. I will be making a statement at 11:00 A.M. from the White House. Thank you!
The U.S. may be getting a little bit lucky with respect to Hurricane Dorian but please don’t let down your guard. As it heads up the coast lots of very bad and unpredictable things can happen! On the other hand the Bahamas have been devastated. We are sending crews to help!
We are apprehending record numbers of illegal immigrants - but we need the Wall to help our great Border Patrol Agents!
I would like to thank Reince Priebus for his service and dedication to his country. We accomplished a lot together and I am proud of him!
Why isn’t the FBI giving Andrew McCabe text messages  to Judicial Watch or appropriate governmental authorities. FBI said they won’t give up even one (I may have to get involved DO NOT DESTROY). What are they hiding? McCabe wife took big campaign dollars from Hillary people.....
FBI Director Comey was the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton in that he gave her a free pass for many bad deeds! The phony...
The Fake News Is going all out in order to demean and denigrate! Such hatred!
The Fake News Media is doing everything they can to crash the economy because they think that will be bad for me and my re-election. The problem they have is that the economy is way too strong and we will soon be winning big on Trade and everyone knows that including China!
The approval process for the biggest Tax Cut & Tax Reform package in the history of our country will soon begin. Move fast Congress!
Consumer Confidence Index just out is the HIGHEST IN 18 YEARS! Also GDP revised upward to 4.2 from 4.1. Our country is doing great!
Aluminum prices are down 12% since I instituted Tariffs on Aluminum Dumping - and the U.S. will be taking in Billions plus jobs. Nice!
In one year Tariffs have rebuilt our Steel Industry - it is booming! We placed a 25% Tariff on "dumped" steel from China & other countries and we now have a big and growing industry. We had to save Steel for our defense and auto industries both of which are coming back strong!
General Anthony Tata author "Dark Winter." I think the President is making the exact right move in Syria. All the geniuses who are protesting the withdrawal of troops from Syria are the same geniuses who cooked the books on ISIS intelligence and gave rise to ISIS."
I am calling on Congress to send me a Bill that fully and permanently funds the LWCF and restores our National Parks. When I sign it into law it will be HISTORIC for our beautiful public lands. ALL thanks to @SenCoryGardner and @SteveDaines two GREAT Conservative Leaders!
....Dr. Anthony Fauci who is with us in all ways a very high 72% Approval Rating. So if he is in charge along with V.P. etc. and with us doing all of these really good things why doesn’t the Lamestream Media treat us as they should? Answer: Because they are Fake News!
Leaving the White House soon to speak at the Pentagon. My great honor!
...sleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman who has since resigned over horrific women abuse when I wanted to close the Foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics. Shady Eric was head of New Yorkers for Clinton and refused to even look at the corrupt Clinton Foundation......

Congratulations to Bill Schuette. You will have a Big win in November and be a tremendous Governor for the Great State of Michigan. Lots of car and other companies moving back!

The Radical Left Democrats will never be satisfied with anything we give them. They will always Resist and Obstruct!
Dem Memo: FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC. Wow!
"Zero evidence that any law was broken. They’re not even alleging that a law was broken. This is an abuse of the Constitution. It is using Impeachment as a campaign tool." @SenTedCruz
Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday. Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care. Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE – Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day!
Mini Mike Bloomberg doesn’t get on the Democrat Debate Stage because he doesn’t want to - he is a terrible debater and speaker. If he did he would go down in the polls even more (if that is possible!).
Big day at the United Nations - many good things and some tricky ones happening. We have a great team. Big speech at 10:00 A.M.

Remember when Iran shot down a drone saying knowingly that it was in their "airspace" when in fact it was nowhere close. They stuck strongly to that story knowing that it was a very big lie. Now they say that they had nothing to do with the attack on Saudi Arabia. We’ll see?
.@foxandfriends   We are not looking to fill all of those positions. Don't need many of them - reduce size of government. @IngrahamAngle
....of Anger and Outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in Peace and Harmony. Fake News Must End!

Just got a briefing on Hurricane Delta rushing toward Louisiana and Mississippi. @fema is there and ready!!!
"Lisa Page Testimony- NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION BEFORE MUELLER APPOINTMENT." @FoxNews by Catherine Herridge. Therefore the case should never have been allowed to be brought. It is a totally illegal Witch Hunt!
Why are the Democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by Crooked Hillary and the phony Russia Investigation? They would get back their credibility. Jerry Nadler Schiff  would have a whole new future open to them. Perhaps they could even run for President!
Pennsylvania has to love Trump because unlike all of the others before me I am bringing STEEL BACK in a VERY BIG way. Plants opening up in Pennsylvania and all over the Country and Congressman Lou Barletta who is running for the Senate in Pennsylvania is really helping!
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was never given or shown a Transcript or Video of the Saudi Consulate event. FAKE NEWS!
The Storms in the Atlantic are very dangerous. We encourage anyone in the path of these storms to prepare themselves and to heed the warnings of State and Local officials. The Federal Government is closely monitoring and ready to assist. We are with you!

....living in the state no matter who they are or how they got there will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people many of whom have never even thought of voting before how and for whom to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!
China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years!
Cryin’ Chuck Schumer said "You will pay the price for this. You won’t know what HIT YOU." That is far beyond simple rhetoric. That is a physical threat or at least a threat that you better vote for us." Trouble ahead!
Defying voters the Governor of California will halt all death penalty executions of 737 stone cold killers. Friends and families of the always forgotten VICTIMS are not thrilled and neither am I!
"President Trump has done more for minority groups in this country than any president in decades."  @LouDobbs
"The very thing that they are accusing President Trump of doing (which I didn’t do) was actually done by Joe Biden. Continues to be a double standard." @RepDevinNunes  @foxandfriends  These people are stone cold Crooked. Also who is this so-called "whistleblower" who doesn’t...
Why is it that the Wall Street Journal though well meaning never mentions the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the U.S. by other countries or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are and will be pouring into U.S. coffers?
"They wanted to know what Trump was up to with the Russians - which of course is nonsense. This whole thing was a complete setup." George Papadopoulos to @seanhannity
Word is that @Greta Van Susteren was let go by her out of control bosses at @NBC & @Comcast because she refused to go along w/ 'Trump hate!'
My Stock Market gains must be judged from the day after the Election November 9 2016 where the Market went up big after the win and because of the win. Had my opponent won CRASH!
Ted Cruz has done so much for Texas including massive cuts in taxes and regulations - which has brought Texas to the best jobs numbers in the history of the state. He watches carefully over your 2nd Amendment. O’Rourke would blow it all! Ted has long had my Strong Endorsement!
James Comey will be replaced by someone who will do a far better job bringing back the spirit and prestige of the FBI.

We are doing very well in our negotiations with China. While I am sure they would love to be dealing with a new administration so they could continue their practice of "ripoff USA"($600 B/year)16 months PLUS is a long time to be hemorrhaging jobs and companies on a long-shot....
We will confront ANY challenge no matter how strong the winds or high the water. I’m proud to stand with Presidents for #OneAmericaAppeal.
"President Trump’s Job Approval Numbers have just reached the highest level since his Inauguration around 50% and you can add to that many votes from voters that don’t talk about their vote. Once they saw the President’s numbers going up they said ‘We gotta do something’ so..
The New York Times Sanctuary Cities/Immigration story today was knowingly wrong on almost every fact. They never call to check for truth. Their sources often don’t even exist a fraud. They will lie & cheat anyway possible to make me look bad. In 6 years they will be gone........
.....hundreds of billions of dollars for the great privilege of losing hundreds of billions of dollars with these same countries on trade. I told them that this situation cannot continue - It is and always has been ridiculously unfair to the United States. Massive amounts.....
Mainstream (FAKE) media refuses to state our long list of achievements including 28 legislative signings strong borders & great optimism!
"Clinton campaign & DNC paid for research that led to the anti-Trump Fake News Dossier. The victim here is the President." @FoxNews

If the Democrats are going to defend the Radical Left "Squad" and King Elijah’s Baltimore Fail it will be a long road to 2020. The good news for the Dems is that they have the Fake News Media in their pocket!

Where’s the Whistleblower? Just read the Transcript everything else is made up garbage by Shifty Schiff and the Never Trumpers!
"Clapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN" @foxandfriends FoxNews  He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN.
Congressional Do Nothing Democrats are being absolutely decimated in their districts on the subject of the Impeachment Hoax. People that voted for them are literally screaming in their faces. Crazy Nancy is finding defending Shifty Schiff harder than she thought! #2020Election
China Trade Deal (and more) in advanced stages. Relationship between our two Countries is very strong. I have therefore agreed to delay U.S. tariff hikes. Let’s see what happens?
....State which I will win in #2020 because they can’t stand her and her hatred of our Country and they appreciate all that I have done for them (opening up mining and MUCH more) which has led to the best employment & economic year in Minnesota’s long and beautiful history!
I (or @VP) never gave Governor Brian Kemp an OK on those few businesses outside of the Guidelines. FAKE NEWS! Spas beauty salons tattoo parlors & barber shops should take a little slower path but I told the Governor to do what is right for the great people of Georgia (& USA)!
Mini Mike Bloomberg will now FIRE Tim O’Brien and all of the fools and truly dumb people who got him into this MESS. This has been the worst and most embarrassing experience of his life...and now on to Sleepy Joe!

Great division between the Bernie Sanders crowd and the other Radical Lefties. Our Country would be destroyed!

Adam Schiff now doesn’t seem to want the Whistleblower to testify. NO! Must testify to explain why he got my Ukraine conversation sooo wrong not even close. Did Schiff tell him to do that? We must determine the Whistleblower’s identity to determine WHY this was done to the USA..
"What is happening to President Trump with Impeachment is a Constitutional Travesty." @GrahamLedger  The likes of which we have never seen before. It is Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi who should be impeached for fraud!
...to ripoff the USA even bigger and better than ever before. The problem with them waiting however is that if & when I win the deal that they get will be much tougher than what we are negotiating now...or no deal at all. We have all the cards our past leaders never got it!
..There will be nobody left in China to do business with. Very bad for China very good for USA! But China has taken so advantage of the U.S. for so many years that they are way ahead (Our Presidents did not do the job). Therefore China should not retaliate-will only get worse!
The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that we play the game because I unlike the Democrats have done nothing wrong!
I am pleased to announce that Mick Mulvaney Director of the Office of Management & Budget will be named Acting White House Chief of Staff replacing General John Kelly who has served our Country with distinction. Mick has done an outstanding job while in the Administration....

Heading back to D.C. Many great things are happening for our Country!
The Democrats are lucky that they don’t have any Mitt Romney types. They may be lousy politicians with really bad policies (Open Borders Sanctuary Cities etc.) but they stick together!
Honduras Mexico and many other countries that the U.S. is very generous to sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES. Caravans are heading here. Must pass tough laws and build the WALL. Democrats allow open borders drugs and crime!
Why aren’t the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton. It’s a Rigged Witch Hunt that’s why! Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration!
....In the meantime our teams will be meeting to work on some solutions to very long term and persistent problems. No rush but I am sure we will ultimately get there!
Congratulations to Sleepy Joe Biden!
"Anti-Trump Network @CNN doing whatever it can to stoke a national Coronavirus panic. The far left Network pretty much ignoring anyone who they interview who doesn’t blame President Trump." @trish_regan @FoxNews Media refuses to discuss the great job our professionals are doing!
Our new Trade Deal with Mexico focuses on FARMERS GROWTH for our country tearing down TRADE BARRIERS JOBS and having companies continue to POUR BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY. It will be a big hit!
.....considered to be the worst and most dangerous addictive and deadly substance of them all. Last year over 77000 people died from Fentanyl. If China cracks down on this "horror drug" using the Death Penalty for distributors and pushers the results will be incredible!
As I predicted Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve have allowed the Dollar to get so strong especially relative to ALL other currencies that our manufacturers are being negatively affected. Fed Rate too high. They are their own worst enemies they don’t have a clue. Pathetic!
Ron @RonDeSantisFL DeSantis had a great debate victory tonight against Andrew Gillum a mayor who presides over one of the worst run and most corrupt cities in Florida. Ron will build on the great job done by Governor Rick Scott. Gillum will make Florida the next Venezuela!
Hard to believe but if Nancy Pelosi had put our great Trade Deal with Mexico and Canada USMCA up for a vote long ago our economy would be even better. If she doesn’t move quickly it will collapse!
Another totally Fake story in the Amazon Washington Post (lobbyist) which states that if my Aides broke the law to build the Wall (which is going up rapidly) I would give them a Pardon. This was made up by the Washington Post only in order to demean and disparage - FAKE NEWS!

We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive). P.M. Justin Trudeau of Canada a very good guy doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs. the U.S.(negotiating) but they do...they almost all do...and that’s how I know!
Spending the morning speaking to @fema and Military relative to CoronaVirus. Also spoke to leaders of various countries including Poland South Korea and Bahrain. Last night had a very gold conversation with the President of Mexico on numerous topics. Border is very strong!

"Taken for Granted" a wonderful new book by Gianno Caldwell on how Conservatism can win back the Americans that Liberalism failed has my full Endorsement!
During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology. Leaders pointed to Qatar - look!
Mark Sanford has been very unhelpful to me in my campaign to MAGA. He is MIA and nothing but trouble. He is better off in Argentina. I fully endorse Katie Arrington for Congress in SC a state I love. She is tough on crime and will continue our fight to lower taxes. VOTE Katie!
Great coordination between agencies at all levels of government. Continuing rains and flash floods are being dealt with. Thousands rescued.
Now the Fake News Media says I "pressured the Ukrainian President at least 8 times during my telephone call with him." This supposedly comes from a so-called "whistleblower" who they say doesn’t even have a first hand account of what was said. More Democrat/Crooked Media con.....

Again the story that there was collusion between the Russians & Trump campaign was fabricated by Dems as an excuse for losing the election.

If schools are mandated to be gun free zones violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!
The President of the Ukraine just stated again in the strongest of language that President Trump applied no pressure and did absolutely nothing wrong. He used the strongest language possible. That should end this Democrat Scam but it won’t because the Dems & Media are FIXED!
With ZERO Democrats to help and a failed expensive and dangerous ObamaCare as the Dems legacy the Republican Senators are working hard!
.....ALSO NOT TRUE! Anything goes with our Corrupt News Media today. They will do or say whatever it takes with not even the slightest thought of consequence! These are true cowards and without doubt THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
"The Democrats are playing politics with Border Security."  @foxandfriends
....Guess what that’s not going to happen! China has just informed us that they (Vice-Premier) are now coming to the U.S. to make a deal. We’ll see but I am very happy with over $100 Billion a year in Tariffs filling U.S. coffers...great for U.S. not good for China!
Statement from China: "The teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other. We are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days." I agree!

....The greatest Witch Hunt in political history!
Tariffs have put the U.S. in a very strong bargaining position with Billions of Dollars and Jobs flowing into our Country - and yet cost increases have thus far been almost unnoticeable. If countries will not make fair deals with us they will be "Tariffed!"

"Everyone knows there was a Spy and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy...Widespread Spying involving multiple people." Mollie Hemingway The Federalist Senior Editor  But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story!
....Dumb and Sick. A really bad show with low ratings - and will only get worse. CNN has been a proven and long term ratings and beyond disaster. In fact it rewarded Chris Cuomo with a now unsuccessful prime time slot despite his massive failure in the morning. Only on CNN!
...."I would like to have the Attorney General (of the United States) call you or your people....." This based on what I have seen is their big point - and it is no point at a all (except for a big win for me!). The Democrats should apologize to the American people!
....and all of the others who have leaked lied and did so many other terrible things? How is it even possible that these people are not being brought forward? Because it is a Rigged Democrat Con Game and the Fake and Corrupt Media loves every minute of it!
Heading to the Southern White House to watch the Funeral Service of Barbara Bush. First Lady Melania has arrived in Houston to pay our respects. Will be a beautiful day!

Senator Bob Corker just stated that "I’m so priveledged to serve in the Senate for twelve years and that’s what I told the people of our state that’s what I’d do serve for two terms." But that is Not True - wanted to run but poll numbers TANKED when I wouldn’t endorse him.....
The Rigged Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on as the "originators and founders" of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. All credibility is gone from this terrible Hoax and much more will be lost as it proceeds. No Collusion!
I am at Camp David working on many things including Iran! We have a great Economy Tariffs have been very helpful both with respect to the huge Dollars coming IN & on helping to make good Trade Deals. The Dow heading to BEST June in 80 years! Stock Market BEST June in 50 years!
Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia. He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship. Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don’t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally the great nation of Australia!
Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade! I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future. We will always have a good (great) relationship!

The Philadelphia shooter should never have been allowed to be on the streets. He had a long and very dangerous criminal record. Looked like he was having a good time after his capture and after wounding so many police. Long sentence - must get much tougher on street crime!
The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes immediately and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved fast and easy. Dems would do it no doubt!
Read the Transcripts! "us" is a reference to USA not me!
Will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (Mar-a-Lago). Stock Market hit new Record High yesterday - $5.5 trillion gain since E. Many companies coming back to the U.S. Military building up and getting very strong.

REMEMBER FLORIDA: I have been President of the United States for almost two years. During that time Senator Bill Nelson didn’t call me once. Rick Scott called constantly requesting dollars plus for Florida. Did a GREAT job on hurricanes. VOTE SCOTT!
Big Senate Race in Alabama on Tuesday. Vote for @TTuberville he is a winner who will never let you down. Jeff Sessions is a disaster who has let us all down. We don’t want him back in Washington!

307000 Veterans Died waiting for Healthcare at the V.A. During Sleepy Joe Biden’s Watch. 800000 Records Stalled! A complete and total disaster.
While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP I don’t like the deal for the United States. Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work. Bilateral deals are far more efficient profitable and better for OUR workers. Look how bad WTO is to U.S.
Even James Clapper has admonished John Brennan for having gone totally off the rails. Maybe Clapper is being nice to me so he doesn’t lose his Security Clearance for lying to Congress!
.....BY THE WAY DON’T CALL ME AGAIN I’LL CALL YOU WHEN YOU’VE DONE WHAT I’VE ASKED.’" A reminder that wasn’t just stupid it was FALSE." @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow @FoxNews  I never said this. Schiff made it up and read it to Congress & the American People. End Witch Hunt!
Watched the debate last night & Beto O’Rourke who wants higher taxes and far more regulations is not in the same league with Ted Cruz & what the great people of Texas stand for & want. Ted is strong on Crime Border & 2nd A loves our Military Vets Low Taxes. Beto is a Flake!
How could Jeff Flake who is setting record low polling numbers in Arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own Senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn’t have a clue) think about running for office even a lower one again? Let’s face it he’s a Flake!
No matter what she says Senator Claire McCaskill will always vote against us and the Great State of Missouri! Vote for Josh Hawley - he will be a great Senator!
Just landed in West Virginia. Big crowd looking forward to seeing everyone soon! #MAGA
How does a politician Cuomo known for pushing people and businesses out of his state not to mention having the highest taxes in the U.S. survive making the statement WE’RE NOT GOING TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN IT WAS NEVER THAT GREAT? Which section of the sentence is worse?
The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention. I backed and campaigned for all of the winners. They give me credit for one. Hopefully Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday.
There has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on China or Russia - Never just look at the facts. The Fake News tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.
Republicans will protect people with pre-existing conditions far better than the Dems!
....very often FAKE NEWS. Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources very much as they did in the long ago past. If they did that the media would be trusted again and Fake News would largely be a thing of the past!
Very good meeting on the Middle East the Military and Trade. Heading back to The Southern White House (Mar-a-Lago!). Updates throughout the day.
....many more mistakes of judgement gets fired because frankly if I listened to him we would be in World War Six by now and goes out and IMMEDIATELY writes a nasty & untrue book. All Classified National Security. Who would do this?
President Xi of China has stated that he is upping the sanctions against #NoKo. Said he wants them to denuclearize. Progress is being made.
Trade negotiations are continuing with China. They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U.S. for many years. Stay tuned!
...Biden is a corrupt globalist sellout who never missed a chance to stab American workers in the back. If Biden wins China wins – it’s just that simple!
July is just the ninth month since 1970 that unemployment has fallen below 4%. Our economy has added 3.7 million jobs since I won the Election. 4.1 GDP. More than 4 million people have received a pay raise due to tax reform. $400 Billion brought back from "overseas." @FoxNews
Many thousands of people work for our government. With that said a former DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE named Miles Taylor who I do not know (never heard of him) said he left & is on the open arms Fake News circuit. Said to be a real "stiff". They will take anyone against us!
Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media. They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day. Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post and they haven’t changed (get new pollsters). Much of the media is a Scam!
FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovernorKayIvey one of the best in our Country has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!).
I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama just look at the facts. Total Fake News!
...They must stop calling these anarchists and agitators "peaceful protestors". Come back into the real world! The Federal Government is ready to end this problem immediately upon your request.
China and the USA are working on selecting a new site for signing of Phase One of Trade Agreement about 60% of total deal after APEC in Chile was canceled do to unrelated circumstances. The new location will be announced soon. President Xi and President Trump will do signing!
Even if we get 100% Republican votes in the Senate we need 10 Democrat votes to get a much needed Immigration Bill - & the Dems are Obstructionists who won’t give votes for political reasons & because they don’t care about Crime coming from Border! So we need to elect more R’s!
My thoughts and prayers are with Pastor Brunson and we hope to have him safely back home soon!
....I would suggest you read the COMPLETE testimony from Tuesday. A false narrative is so bad for our Country. I value our intelligence community. Happily we had a very good meeting and we are all on the same page!
The LameStream Media had a very bad week. They pushed numerous phony stories and got caught especially The Failing New York Times which has lost more money over the last 10 years than any paper in history and The Amazon Washington Post. They are The Enemy of the People!
Washington Examiner - "MAGA list: 205 ‘historic results’ help Trump make case for 2020 re-election."  True!
....IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY! We went to war under a false & now disproven premise WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION. There were NONE! Now we are slowly & carefully bringing our great soldiers & military home. Our focus is on the BIG PICTURE! THE USA IS GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE!

New home sales reach a 10 year high. Stock Market has more record gains. Hopefully Republican Senators will give us the much needed Tax Cuts to keep it all going! Democrats want big Tax Increases.
A great new book just out "Game of Thorns" by Doug Wead Presidential Historian and best selling author. The book covers the campaign of 2016 and what could be more exciting than that?
James Clapper who famously got caught lying to Congress is now an authority on Donald Trump. Will he show you his beautiful letter to me?
Five deaths have been recorded thus far with regard to hurricane Florence! Deepest sympathies and warmth go out to the families and friends of the victims. May God be with them!
Congressman Ted Yoho of Florida is doing a fantastic job and has my complete and total Endorsement! Tough on Crime and Borders Ted was really helpful on Tax Cuts. Vote all the way for Ted in the upcoming Primary - he will never let you down!
The United States is learning much from the failed missile explosion in Russia. We have similar though more advanced technology. The Russian "Skyfall" explosion has people worried about the air around the facility and far beyond. Not good!
Just spoke to @JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @WestervillePD. This is a true tragedy!

...& overwhelming" but this Scam Impeachment was neither. Also very unfair with no Due Process proper representation or witnesses. Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans weren’t allowed to have in the House. Dems want to run majority Republican Senate. Hypocrites!
What is the purpose of the House doing good immigration bills when you need 9 votes by Democrats in the Senate and the Dems are only looking to Obstruct (which they feel is good for them in the Mid-Terms). Republicans must get rid of the stupid Filibuster Rule-it is killing you!

For the record I have no financial interests in Saudi Arabia (or Russia for that matter). Any suggestion that I have is just more FAKE NEWS (of which there is plenty)!
Jon Tester says one thing to voters and does the EXACT OPPOSITE in Washington. Tester takes his orders form Pelosi & Schumer. Tester wants to raise your taxes take away your 2A open your borders and deliver MOB RULE. Retire Tester & Elect America-First Patriot Matt Rosendale!
One of the great things about the China Deal is the fact that for various reasons we do not have to go through the very long and politically complex Congressional Approval Process. When the deal is fully negotiated I sign it myself on behalf of our Country. Fast and Clean!

Big progress at the Border but Dems in Congress must change the Immigration Laws for all to be good! End the Loopholes and much more.
....Whatever happened to the so-called "informer" to Whistleblower #1? Seems to have disappeared after I released the Transcript of the call. Shouldn’t he be on the list to testify? Witch Hunt!

Getting ready to leave for one of my favorite places the Florida Panhandle where we’ve given and are giving billions of $$$ for the devastation caused by Hurricane Michael. Even though the Dems are totally in our way (they don’t want money to go there) we’re getting it done!
Presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get Germany and other rich NATO Nations to pay more toward their protection from Russia. They pay only a fraction of their cost. The U.S. pays tens of Billions of Dollars too much to subsidize Europe and loses Big on Trade!
Chairman Kim realizes perhaps better than anyone else that without nuclear weapons his country could fast become one of the great economic powers anywhere in the World. Because of its location and people (and him) it has more potential for rapid growth than any other nation!
RINO Governor Charlie Baker of Massachusetts is unsuccessfully trying to defend Mail In Ballots when there is fraud being found all over the place. Just look at some of the recent races or the Trump Ballots in Pennsylvania that were thrown into the garbage. Wrong Charlie!

The G7 in France was so successful and yet when I came back and read the Corrupt and Fake News and watched numerous networks it was not even recognizable from what actually took place at the Great G7 event!

Democrats are incapable of doing a good and solid Immigration Bill!
The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey including the fact that he should be fired but now they play so sad!

Farmers have been on a downward trend for 15 years. The price of soybeans has fallen 50% since 5 years before the Election. A big reason is bad (terrible) Trade Deals with other countries. They put on massive Tariffs and Barriers. Canada charges 275% on Dairy. Farmers will WIN!

.....years and $30 million and they found No Collusion No Obstruction. But the Democrats no matter what we give them will NEVER be satisfied. A total waste of time. As @FrankLuntz has just stated "Enough America has had enough. What have you accomplished. Public is fed up."
"It’s a trap because they want to tank the economy and make everything look trrrible so they can make President Trump look bad in November. They want Trump to have to send in troops so it looks bad for him."  Dave Rubin author of "Don’t Burn This Book." @seanhannity
....and other really bad people SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN! They even had an "insurance policy" just in case Crooked Hillary Clinton and the Democrats lost their race for the Presidency! This is the biggest & worst political scandal in the history of the United States of America. Sad!
Just concluded a very good meeting on preventing Mass Shootings. Talks are ongoing w/ both Republicans & Democrats. We are likewise engaging with lawful gun owners survivors grieving family members law enforcement the NRA mental health professionals and school officials...
"The Trump Administration Trump policies have put our economy on a trajectory it has never been on before." Griff Jenkins @foxandfriends
The Impeachment Witch Hunt should be over with the statement made last night by the President and Foreign Minister of Ukraine. Nervous Nancy Pelosi who should be home cleaning up the dangerous & disgusting Slum she is making of her District in San Francisco where even the......
....His problem is interesting. He must always be weak on CRIME because of the Bernie Sanders Radical Left voter. If he loses them like Crooked Hillary did he is "toast" and many will vote for me because of TRADE (Bernie was good on trade). Joe MUST always be weak on crime!
Crazy Bernie Sanders is not a fighter. He gives up too easy! The Dem establishment gets Alfred E. Newman (Mayor Pete) & @amyklobuchar to quit & endorse Sleepy Joe BEFORE Super Tuesday & gets Pocahontas to stay in the race taking thousands of votes from Bernie. He would have....
...Additionally the remaining 300 BILLION DOLLARS of goods and products from China that was being taxed from September 1st at 10% will now be taxed at 15%. Thank you for your attention to this matter!
This morning I will be going to the Commissioning Ceremony for the largest aircraft carrier in the world The Gerald R. Ford.  Norfolk Va.
....fiction to Congress and the American People?  I demand his deposition. He is a fraud just like the Russia Hoax was and the Ukraine Hoax is now. When do the Do Nothing Democrats pay a price for what they are doing to our Country & when do the Republicans finally fight back?
.....was very good and highly professional to deal with - and if for any reason I didn’t like them I would have gone elsewhere....there was always plenty of money around and banks to choose from. They would be very happy to take my money. Fake News!
The truth is that we have a nation that is disgusted with the FBI. We have a crisis of confidence in the number one law enforcement agency in this country (thanks Comey!). @LouDobbs "It’s a scandal." @AlanDersh
The Federal Reserve must be a leader not a very late follower which it has been!
"It appears that an American spy in one of our intelligence agencies may have been spying on our own president. The complaint suggests that this intel agent was listening in on Trump’s conversation....
Hunter Biden was really bad on @GMA. Now Sleepy Joe has real problems! Reminds me of Crooked Hillary and her 33000 deleted Emails not recoverable!
The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board doesn’t have a clue on how to fight and win. Their views on Tariffs & Trade are losers for the U.S. but winners for other countries including China. If we followed their standards  we’d have no Country left. They should love Sleepy Joe!
.."This is an astounding development in journalism. I’ve never seen it happen before I’ve just never seen anything like this! Is that journalism today? I don’t think so!" Mark Penn Former Clinton Advisor. @TuckerCarlson After 3 years I almost got a good headline from the Times!
Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again she needs the rest. Sleep well Hillary - see you at the debate!
...completely avoided if you buy from a non-Tariffed Country or you buy the product inside the USA (the best idea). That’s Zero Tariffs. Many Tariffed companies will be leaving China for Vietnam and other such countries in Asia. That’s why China wants to make a deal so badly!...
Tremendous win for Congressman Dan Donovan. You showed great courage in a tough race! New York and my many friends on Staten Island have elected someone they have always been very proud of. Congratulations!
Wow! @foxandfriends blew away the competition of Morning Joke (which did very poorly) on MSDNC (Another Comcast sleaze production) and @CNN’s New Day in the Morning Television Ratings. A total blowout but that’s what you get when you treat "Trump" fairly!
Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a "tenfold" increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction made up to demean. NBC = CNN!
Looking at Air Force One @ MIA. Why is he campaigning instead of creating jobs & fixing Obamacare? Get back to work for the American people!
....We will then spend (match or better) the money that China may no longer be spending with our Great Patriot Farmers (Agriculture) which is a small percentage of total Tariffs received and distribute the food to starving people in nations around the world! GREAT! #MAGA
...really hard to help but many have lost their homes. Military is now on site and I will be there Tuesday. Wish press would treat fairly!
Chicago will never stop its crime wave with the current Superintendent of Police. It just won’t happen! Thank you to Kevin Graham and all of the GREAT Chicago Police Officers I just had the privilege to meet. Tremendous crime fighting potential if allowed to do your thing!
According to Fake News (and low ratings) @CNN "Democrats say hearings could change impeachment debate." That’s because they have lost the impeachment debate (80% say NO) and they are hoping that yet another DO OVER after 2 1/2 years and $40000000 will turn things around....
"90% of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative" -and much of it contrived!@foxandfriends
...people not interviewed including Clinton herself. Comey stated under oath that he didn't do this-obviously a fix? Where is Justice Dept?
"From a Turkish prison to the White House in 24 hours."  Kristin Fisher of @FoxNews   Very cool!
Leaving Michigan now great visit heading for Iowa. Big Rally!
From @FoxNews "Bombshell: In 2016 Obama dismissed idea that anyone could rig an American election."  Check out his statement - Witch Hunt!
It is actually hard to believe how naive (or dumb) the Failing @nytimes is when it comes to foreign policy...weak and ineffective!
...Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved. The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country!
....terrible thing to watch especially when things could be taken care of sooo easily. We will WIN anyway but it would be much easier if the Fed understood which they don’t that we are competing against other countries all of whom want to do well at our expense!
....greatly help the African American community (and all other communities) and which was unable to get done in past administrations despite a tremendous desire for it. This and best unemployment numbers EVER is more than Kamala will EVER be able to do for African Americans!
The Fake News media is officially out of control. They will do or say anything in order to get attention - never been a time like this!
...handled. I told @theresa_may how to do that deal but she went her own foolish way-was unable to get it done. A disaster! I don’t know the Ambassador but have been told he is a pompous fool. Tell him the USA now has the best Economy & Military  anywhere in the World by far...
Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity on @FoxNews at 10:00pm tonight. Enjoy!
I will be announcing my decision on the Paris Accord over the next few days. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
....Therefore based on both Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility we will no longer consider Trump National Doral Miami as the Host Site for the G-7 in 2020. We will begin the search for another site including the possibility of Camp David immediately. Thank you!
....results on "Trump News" are from National Left-Wing Media very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!
.... Amazon like the Washington Post. It’s hard to remember that not so long ago America had prestige media outlets but not anymore." @TuckerCarlson   The Fake News Media is the true Enemy of the People!
A new INTELLIGENCE LEAK from the Amazon Washington Postthis time against A.G. Jeff Sessions.These illegal leaks like Comey's must stop!
The Oil Fields discussed in my speech on Turkey/Kurds yesterday were held by ISIS until the United States took them over with the help of the Kurds. We will NEVER let a reconstituted ISIS have those fields!
No matter how much I accomplish during the ridiculous standard of the first 100 days & it has been a lot (including S.C.) media will kill!
Great Rally in Pennsylvania last night. Congressman Lloyd Smucker (PA-11) was there and I informed him that he has my complete and total Endorsement for the upcoming 2020 Election. Lloyd has done a great job. I am with him all the way!  #MAGA
Perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of U.S. companies been better than they are today!
Just signed a critical bill to formalize drought contingency plans for the Colorado River. Thanks to @SenMcSallyAZ for getting it done. Big deal for Arizona!
My meeting in Argentina with President Xi of China was an extraordinary one. Relations with China have taken a BIG leap forward! Very good things will happen. We are dealing from great strength but China likewise has much to gain if and when a deal is completed. Level the field!
Talks on Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare are and have been going on and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck.
Looking for China to open their Markets not only to Financial Services which they are now doing but also to our Manufacturing Farmers and other U.S. businesses and industries. Without this a deal would be unacceptable!
The United States is spending far more on NATO than any other Country. This is not fair nor is it acceptable. While these countries have been increasing their contributions since I took office they must do much more. Germany is at 1% the U.S. is at 4% and NATO benefits.......
My @SuperBowl Interview at 3:30 P.M. on @foxnetworks. Enjoy!
"It has been 3 years and Donald Trump hasn’t done anything wrong. Donald Trump hasn’t done a single thing of which he has been accused." @RushLimbaughEIB  @seanhannity  A Witch Hunt like no other!

Republicans in the Senate will NEVER win if they don't go to a 51 vote majority NOW. They look like fools and are just wasting time......
.... Their response to H1N1 Swine Flu was a full scale disaster with thousands dying and nothing meaningful done to fix the testing problem until now. The changes have been made and testing will soon happen on a very large scale basis. All Red Tape has been cut ready to go!
Bernie Sanders is pushing hard for a single payer healthcare plan - a curse on the U.S. & its people...
Senator Mitch McConnell should fight for the Wall and Border Security as hard as he fought for anything. He will need Democrat votes but as shown in the House good things happen. If enough Dems don’t vote it will be a Democrat Shutdown! House Republicans were great yesterday!
Great job being done by the @VP and the CoronaVirus Task Force. Thank you!
"There’s nothing there! I’m trying to let the House know that they’re dividing America for no good reason. We’ve got a lot of things we should be doing like lowering drug costs & getting a trade deal with Mexico and Canada." @LindseyGrahamSC  The Do Nothing Dems have gone crazy!
So @TeamCavuto has very bad ratings on @foxnews with his Fake guests like A.B.Stoddard and others that still haven’t figured it all out. Will he get the same treatment as his friend Shepherd Smith who also suffered from the ratings drought?
Great job FEMA First Responders and Law Enforcement - not easy very dangerous tremendous talent. America is proud of you. Keep it all going - finish strong!
There will be a News Conference by the CoronaVirus Task Force today at the White House 5 P.M. @VP  We are working closely with the Governors of our Country’s great States which are a very big factor. They are working hard along with us to get the job properly done.....
"Andrew McCabe gave absolutely no evidence of any threat to substantiate his ABSURD claim." @LouDobbs
Very good numbers on the economy. Much potential for growth. Trade deals being negotiated or being set up for negotiation. We have been treated very unfairly (to put it mildly) by other countries for many years but that is changing!
....guilty even on a civil basis. Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. As a lawyer Michael has great liability to me!
"The vindication belongs to the President for firing James Comey. It was clearly the right thing to do. You don’t want an FBI Director with Jim Comey’s ethics." Jason Riley Wall Street Journal
The lawyer for the Whistleblower takes away all credibility from this big Impeachment Scam! It should be ended and the Whistleblower his lawyer and Corrupt politician Schiff should be investigared for fraud!
"This is everything FDR dreamed about the New Deal to put America back to work. Think of LBJ he gave people food stamps & welfare. Donald Trump’s giving them a job. He’s got a lot of good things to talk about. News stories do not accurately cover him should correct." @DougWead
The U.S. has an increased economic value of more than 7 Trillion Dollars since the Election. May be the best economy in the history of our country. Record Jobs numbers. Nice!
Go Republican Senators Go! Get there after waiting for 7 years. Give America great healthcare!
BIG NEWS by @Hyundai @Kia and @Aptiv on a 4 BILLION DOLLAR joint venture to develop autonomous driving technologies in the USA. That’s a lot of $$ and JOBS! Great jobs coming back to America!!
Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader Yale and then Harvard Law who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!
Look forward to meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany today. So much to discuss so little time! It will be good for both of our great countries!
FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits. 90 days to go?!!!

....Scott has helped us to lower drug prices get a record number of generic drugs approved and onto the market and so many other things. He and his talents will be greatly missed!
..Breaking News: The Ukrainian Government just said they weren’t pressured at all during the "nice" call. Sleepy Joe Biden on the other hand forced a tough prosecutor out from investigating his son’s company by threat of not giving big dollars to Ukraine. That’s the real story!
DACA was abandoned by the Democrats. Very unfair to them! Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall.
....U.S. in order to avoid paying the 25% Tariff. Like Mexican companies will move back to the United States once the Tariff reaches the higher levels. They took many of our companies & jobs the foolish Pols let it happen and now they will come back unless Mexico stops the.....
.@TuckerCarlson speaking of John Brennan: "How did somebody so obviously limited intellectually get to be CIA Director in the first place?" Now that is a really good question! Then followed by "Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut is a FAKE War Hero..." So true a total Fake!
The Radical Left Dems and LameStream Media are just trying to make it hard for Republicans and me to win in 2020. The new Impeachment Hoax is already turning against them!
Nadler hasn’t had a single fact witness testify! Zero substance—Country wants #USMCA and Growth not Impeachment. Polls have tanked on the Do Nothing Democrats!
Will be leaving the Philippines tomorrow after many days of constant mtgs & work in order to #MAGA! My promises are rapidly being fulfilled.
Dems failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia. Great job Karen Handel! It is now Hollywood vs. Georgia on June 20th.
....John Deere our car companies & others to compete on a level playing field. With substantial Fed Cuts (there is no inflation) and no quantitative tightening the dollar will make it possible for our companies to win against any competition. We have the greatest companies...
.@LouDobbs just stated that "President Trump's successes are unmatched in recent presidential history"  Thank you Lou!
....I say of course they’re low - because for the first time in 50 years I am making them pay a big price for doing business with America. Why should they like me? — But I still like them!
Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation. The April 2009-10 Swine Flu where nearly 13000 people died in the U.S. was poorly handled. Ask MSDNC & lightweight Washington failure @RonaldKlain who the President was then?
The ABC/Washington Post Poll even though almost 40% is not bad at this time was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!
Leaving South Korea now heading to China. Looking very much forward to meeting and being with President Xi!
John Brennan on the Mueller probe "I don’t know if I received bad information but I THINK I SUSPECTED THAT THERE WAS MORE THAN THERE ACTUALLY WAS." Wow he admits he was wrong! Congress should go back to work on drug prices etc.
While I very much appreciate P.M. Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready and neither are we!
The U.S. has the worst of the ISIS prisoners. Turkey and the Kurds must not let them escape. Europe should have taken them back after numerous requests. They should do it now. They will never come to or be allowed in the United States!
Any increase in ObamaCare premiums is the fault of the Democrats for giving us a "product" that never had a chance of working.
The weak illegal immigration policies of the Obama Admin. allowed bad MS 13 gangs to form in cities across U.S. We are removing them fast!
Fantastic job on @foxandfriends by new Republican Superstar @SeanParnellUSA running for Congress (with my complete & total Endorsement) against a Crazy Nancy Pelosi Puppet (who has done nothing!) & a slightly older Republican Superstar @GovMikeHuckabee. Thank you to both!

The Hill/HarrisX: 61% to 39% Approval Rating on handling of Coronavirus situation. Thank you!
It’s a stupendous number. It’s joyous let’s call it like it is. The Market was right. It’s stunning! @jimcramer  @CNBC
....In any event it goes on and on & the new AG who is now being replaced by yet another AG (who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda) does little else but rant rave & politic against me. Will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of "justice."
China will be pumping money into their system and probably reducing interest rates as always in order to make up for the business they are and will be losing. If the Federal Reserve ever did a "match" it would be game over we win! In any event China wants a deal!
....employment numbers ever low taxes & regulations a rebuilt military & V.A. many great new judges & so much more. But we have had a giant SCAM perpetrated upon our nation a Witch Hunt a Treasonous Hoax. That is the Constitutional Crisis & hopefully guilty people will pay!
..My team is negotiating with them now but they always change the deal in the end to their benefit. They should probably wait out our Election to see if we get one of the Democrat stiffs like Sleepy Joe. Then they could make a GREAT deal like in past 30 years and continue
Congratulations to Michael Pack! Nobody has any idea what a big victory this is for America. Why? Because he is going to be running the VOICE OF AMERICA (@VOANews) and everything associated with it...
"Trump Stock Market rally is far outpacing past U.S. presidents" @CNBC  With new trade deals and more THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
Steve Moore a great pro-growth economist and a truly fine person has decided to withdraw from the Fed process. Steve won the battle of ideas including Tax Cuts....
....Now the new big story is that Trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash he doesn’t need banks. But where did he get all of that cash? Could it be Russia? No I built a great business and don’t need banks but if I did they would be there...and DeutscheBank......
Just arrived in Italy for the G7. Trip has been very successful. We made and saved the USA many billions of dollars and millions of jobs.
When and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax. There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted. It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election. Where is the server?
Will be speaking with Italy this morning!
DEMOCRAT CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ARE #RIGGED!
....He is tough on Crime Strong on Borders and will fight for our Second Amendment. Daniel will never let you down. He has my Full and Complete Endorsement!
The Democrats should change the Loopholes and Asylum Laws so lives will be saved at our Southern Border. They said it was not a crisis at the Border that it was all just "manufactured." Now they admit that I was right - But they must do something about it. Fix the Laws NOW!
Republicans are going for the big Budget approval today first step toward massive tax cuts. I think we have the votes but who knows?
Total inaction on DACA by Dems. Where are you? A deal can be made!
Now with our new deal Mexico is doing more for the USA on Illegal Immigration than the Democrats. In fact the Democrats are doing NOTHING they want Open Borderswhich means Illigal Immigration Drugs and Crime.
...Texas will defend them & indemnify them against political harassment by New York State and Governor Cuomo. So many people are leaving New York for Texas and Florida that it is totally under siege. First New York taxes you too high then they sue you just to complete the job
Not only did Congressman Ron DeSantis easily win the Republican Primary but his opponent in November is his biggest dream....a failed Socialist Mayor named Andrew Gillum who has allowed crime & many other problems to flourish in his city. This is not what Florida wants or needs!
....persecuted on old and/or totally unrelated charges (there was no collusion and there was no obstruction of the no collusion)...And what is going on in the FBI & DOJ with Crooked Hillary the DNC and all of the lies? A disgraceful situation!
The Justice Dept. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban not the watered down politically correct version they submitted to S.C.
"House votes on controversial FISA ACT today." This is the act that may have been used with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?
It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media.
The Democrats see chaos as their way while President Trump sees the Rule of Law. Mayor @kenblackwell Thank you Ken!
I am pleased to announce my nomination of four-star General Mark Milley Chief of Staff of the United States Army – as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff replacing General Joe Dunford who will be retiring....
.....Except the results are FAR BETTER than I ever said they were going to be! I campaigned against the NEVER ENDING WARS remember!
Big meeting today with Republican leadership concerning Tax Cuts and Healthcare. We are all pushing hard - must get it right!
The Border has been a big mess and problem for many years. At some point Schumer and Pelosi who are weak on Crime and Border security will be forced to do a real deal so easy that solves this long time problem. Schumer used to want Border security - now he’ll take Crime!
"Why re-elect Democrats when you know that this is what they are doing with their majority. Their case is not strong because first it was Russian Collusion then it was obstruction then it was Ukraine now their pivoting back to Russia. Why would they be doing that?" Lisa Booth

Heading to the Great State of Kentucky - Big Rally for Congressman Andy Barr - Fantastic guy need his vote for MAGA! Strong on Crime Tax Cuts Military Vets & 2nd A. His opponent will NEVER vote for us only for Pelosi. Andy has my Strongest Endorsement!!! See you in Kentucky.
The Budget passed late last night 51 to 49. We got ZERO Democrat votes with only Rand Paul (he will vote for Tax Cuts) voting against.....
Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation Andrew McCabe got $700000 from H for wife!
Getting out of Syria was no surprise. I’ve been campaigning on it for years and six months ago when I very publicly wanted to do it I agreed to stay longer. Russia Iran Syria & others are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing there work. Time to come home & rebuild. #MAGA
While all agree the U. S. President has the complete power to pardon why think of that when only crime so far is LEAKS against us.FAKE NEWS
.@MikeGarcia2020 will be a tremendous fighter for the U.S. and the State of California. An Annapolis graduate he served our Country as a highly decorated Navy Fighter Pilot and will be a great Congressman (#CA25). Loves our Military and Vets...
Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey said that President Trump is probably correct that there was surveillance on Trump Tower. Actually far greater than would ever have been believed!
Congratulations to Heather Wilson who is the sole finalist to become the next President of University of Texas at El Paso effective September 1 2019. Heather has done an absolutely fantastic job...
....but now we are moving forward like never before. We are winning again and we are respected again!

....Joe Biden and Bernie is shut out again. Very unfair but that’s the way the Democrats play the game. Anyway it’s a lot of fun to watch!
Just heard that Sean Spicer will be on "Dancing with the Stars." He will do great. A terrific person who loves our Country dearly!
....that they are trying to pull off in violation of everything that our Country stands for. Vote NO to the Pelosi/ Schumer money wasting HOAX which is taking place now. Then fight the $51 million unasked for Ballots. Only ABSENTEE BALLOTS are acceptable!
Thank you for all of the compliments on getting the World Cup to come to the U.S.A. Mexico and Canada. I worked hard on this along with a Great Team of talented people. We never fail and it will be a great World Cup! A special thanks to Bob Kraft for excellent advice.
The Amazon Washington Post front page story yesterday was total Fake News. They said "Advisors wrote new talking points and handed him reams of opposition research on the four Congresswomen." Now really does that sound like me? What advisors there were no talking points....
....into the future will continue. In the meantime the United States has imposed Tariffs on China which may or may not be removed depending on what happens with respect to future negotiations!
The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or CFPB has been a total disaster as run by the previous Administrations pick. Financial Institutions have been devastated and unable to properly serve the public. We will bring it back to life!
The very outdated filibuster rule must go. Budget reconciliation is killing R's in Senate. Mitch M go to 51 Votes NOW and WIN. IT'S TIME!
Germany sells 30 year bonds offering negative yields. Germany competes with the USA. Our Federal Reserve does not allow us to do what we must do. They put us at a disadvantage against our competition. Strong Dollar No Inflation! They move like quicksand. Fight or go home!
.@NBCNews is facing considerable backlash for pushing @Google to remove Conservative sites from its ad platform.
.....But should be much higher than that if Twitter wasn’t playing their political games. No wonder Congress wants to get involved - and they should. Must be more and fairer companies to get out the WORD!
The Radical Left Democrats have failed on all fronts so now they are pushing local New York City and State Democrat prosecutors to go get President Trump. A thing like this has never happened to any President before. Not even close!
Republican Senators are working very hard to get there with no help from the Democrats. Not easy! Perhaps just let OCare crash & burn!
A great new book just out "The Plot Against the President. The True Story Of How Congressman Devin Nunez Uncovered the Biggest Political Scandal In U.S. History." Shows very bad and corrupt people on the other side. Check it out!
Will be in Minnesota on Thursday night. Massive response crowd and enthusiasm (actually all over the Country) will be beyond belief! Same thing in Louisiana on Friday. Big and Bold USA!
....so that they will be more competitive for USA buyers. We are now a much bigger economy than China and have substantially increased in size since the great 2016 Election. We are the "piggy bank" that everyone wants to raid and take advantage of. NO MORE!
I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other Cryptocurrencies which are not money and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior including drug trade and other illegal activity....
For the record there were MANY people who wanted to be the White House Chief of Staff. Mick M will do a GREAT job!
"I mean come on. The Democrats are doing focus groups to try and figure out what words to use to move the needle. The Democrats know this is political and they’re just trying to drag Trump’s name into the mud!" Lisa Booth @foxandfriends Thank you Lisa!

What the Market wanted to hear from Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve was that this was the beginning of a lengthy and aggressive rate-cutting cycle which would keep pace with China The European Union and other countries around the world....
...and did not want to "rock the boat." He didn't "choke" he colluded or obstructed and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.
...Europe far more than it does the U.S. By some accounts the U.S. is paying for 90% of NATO with many countries nowhere close to their 2% commitment. On top of this the European Union has a Trade Surplus of $151 Million with the U.S. with big Trade Barriers on U.S. goods. NO!
The failing @nytimes wrote a Fake piece today implying that because White House Councel Don McGahn was giving hours of testimony to the Special Councel he must be a John Dean type "RAT." But I allowed him and all others to testify - I didn’t have to. I have nothing to hide......
....There are lots of really good lawyers in the country he could have picked somebody else!" And I wish I did!
I will be interviewed on "60 Minutes" tonight at 7:00 P.M. after NFL game. Enjoy!
...China as a "positive development" for America and the world. If it were up to Joe bin Laden and Soleimani would still be alive ISIS would be still on the rampage and China would now be the dominant power in the world – not America.
Thank you to @mirandadevine of the New York Post for your interesting (and correct) column today. "Trump has gained 20 points since Impeachment began in October. He gets 67% on economy. Nonwhite approval of Trump is also at a high: 28% up 10 points in a year. Nice one Nancy."
"It’s political season and the election is around the corner. They want to continue to push that racist narrative." @ainsleyearhardt @foxandfriends  And I am the least racist person. Black Hispanic and Asian Unemployment is the lowest (BEST) in the history of the United States!
Great to see the Senate working on solutions to end the secrecy around ridiculously high drug prices something I called for in my drug pricing Blueprint. Will now work with the House to help American patients! #AmericanPatientsFirst
Was the brother of John Podesta paid big money to get the sanctions on Russia lifted? Did Hillary know?
Congratulations to @predsednikrs Vucic for announcing the move of Serbia’s Embassy to Jerusalem by July. It is a brave and historic move!
....Think of what it could have been if the Fed had gotten it right. Thousands of points higher on the Dow and GDP in the 4’s or even 5’s. Now they stick like a stubborn child when we need rates cuts & easing to make up for what other countries are doing against us. Blew it!
Without the ILLEGAL Witch Hunt my poll numbers especially because of our historically "great" economy would be at 65%. Too bad! The greatest Hoax in American History.
Good day in the Stock Market. People have no idea the tremendous potential our Country has for GROWTH - and many other things!
The Pledge of Allegiance to our great Country in St. Louis Park Minnesota is under siege. That is why I am going to win the Great State of Minnesota in the 2020 Election. People are sick and tired of this stupidity and disloyalty to our wonderful USA!
Getting ready to leave for Europe. First meeting - NATO. The U.S. is spending many times more than any other country in order to protect them. Not fair to the U.S. taxpayer. On top of that we lose $151 Billion on Trade with the European Union. Charge us big Tariffs (& Barriers)!
China is intent on continuing to receive the hundreds of Billions of Dollars they have been taking from the U.S. with unfair trade practices and currency manipulation. So one-sided it should have been stopped many years ago!
....The Witch Hunt is over but we will never forget. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
....that when this Administration’s alternative is no longer available California will squeeze them to a point of business ruin. Only reason California is now talking to them is because the Feds are giving a far better alternative which is much better for consumers!
...and people like Ms. Heyer. Such a disgusting lie. He just can't forget his election trouncing.The people of South Carolina will remember!

The only thing James Comey ever got right was when he said that President Trump was not under investigation!

The Whistleblower who had the facts wrong about the phone call reached out and more to the Democrat controlled House Intelligence Committee. Schiff never told us about this!
Saddened to hear about the loss of John Pinto a Navajo Code Talker in World War II over the Memorial Day Weekend. The Code Talkers are true American HEROES and John never stopped serving his fellow citizens as a longtime New Mexico State Senator. John Rest In Peace!

...Based on that the Military has hit ISIS "much harder" over the last two days. They will pay a big price for every attack on us!
"Charges Deal Don A Big Win" written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost succinctly states that "the Russians had no impact on the election results." There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign. "She lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate. Case closed."
.@RepMikeTurner  "The only time that Michael Cohen told the truth is when he pled that he is guilty."  Also when he said no collusion and I did not tell him to lie!"

"Congressman Van Drew (D-NJ) SLAMS Democrats for ‘fracturing the Nation’ with Impeachment probe. ‘We already know how it’s going to end." @FoxNews
The reason that the small truck business in the U.S. is such a go to favorite is that for many years Tariffs of 25% have been put on small trucks coming into our country. It is called the "chicken tax." If we did that with cars coming in many more cars would be built here.....
"The President has a really good story to tell. We have unemployment lower than we’ve seen in decades. We have people who stopped looking for work coming back into the labor force. We are in a record growth period." Michael Steel @MSNBC (do you believe?)

Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems & Fake News until the Republican won? V was poorly covered

Washington Post employees want to go on strike because Bezos isn’t paying them enough. I think a really long strike would be a great idea. Employees would get more money and we would get rid of Fake News for an extended period of time! Is @WaPo a registered lobbyist?

Alan Dershowitz Harvard Law Professor: "It all proves that we never needed a Special Counsel....All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept. Don’t need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone’s back. Not the way Justice should operate." So true!
Looking forward to being with the wonderful Bush family at Blair House today. The former First Lady will be coming over to the White House this morning to be given a tour of the Christmas decorations by Melania. The elegance & precision of the last two days have been remarkable!
Sen. Jeff Flake(y) who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on "mike" saying bad things about your favorite President. He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is "toast."
I suggest that we add more dollars to Healthcare and make it the best anywhere. ObamaCare is dead - the Republicans will do much better!

Will be going to Ohio tonight to campaign for Troy Balderson for the big Congressional Special Election on Tuesday. Early voting is on. Troy is strong on Crime the Border & loves our Military Vets & 2nd Amendment. His opponent is a puppet of Nancy Pelosi/high taxes.
....attend the big parade already scheduled at Andrews Air Force Base on a different date & go to the Paris parade celebrating the end of the War on November 11th. Maybe we will do something next year in D.C. when the cost comes WAY DOWN. Now we can buy some more jet fighters!

Big Trade Deal just agreed to with Prime Minister Abe of Japan. Will be great for our Farmers Ranchers and more. Really big Corn purchase!
I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again?
....If we bought 15 Billion Dollars of Agriculture from our Farmers far more than China buys now we would have more than 85 Billion Dollars left over for new Infrastructure Healthcare or anything else. China would greatly slow down and we would automatically speed up!
...things up better than ever before but it can’t go too quickly. I am fighting for a level playing field for our farmers and will win!
Congratulations to  @GreggJarrett on The TREMENDOUS success of his just out book "The Russia Hoax The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton & Frame Donald Trump." Already number one on Amazon. Hard work from a brilliant guy. It’s the Real Story of the Rigged Witch Hunt!

Big day in Washington D.C. even though White House & Oval Office are being renovated. Great trade deals coming for American workers!
Democrat Jon Ossoff who wants to raise your taxes to the highest level and is weak on crime and security doesn't even live in district.
China the European Union and others have been manipulating their currencies and interest rates lower while the U.S. is raising rates while the dollars gets stronger and stronger with each passing day - taking away our big competitive edge. As usual not a level playing field...
Tremendous things achieved for U.S. on my NATO trip. Proudly for our Country no President has ever achieved so much in so little time. Without a U.S. increase other countries have already increased by $130 Billion-with $400 Billion soon. Such a thing has never been done before!

...(Democrats said I never met) and released the military aid to Ukraine without any conditions or investigations - and far ahead of schedule. I also allowed Ukraine to purchase Javelin anti-tank missiles. My Administration has done far more than the previous Administration.
British Prime Minister May was very angry that the info the U.K. gave to U.S. about Manchester was leaked. Gave me full details!
Too bad the Dems in Congress won’t do anything at all about Border Security. They want Open Borders which means crime. But we are getting it done including building the Wall! More people than ever before are coming because the USA Economy is so good the best in history.
Q2 GDP Up 2.1% Not bad considering we have the very heavy weight of the Federal Reserve anchor wrapped around our neck. Almost no inflation. USA is set to Zoom!
I hope the people over at the Fed will read today’s Wall Street Journal Editorial before they make yet another mistake. Also don’t let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B’s. Feel the market don’t just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!
My Administration will be fighting for $200 million for the Army Corps Everglades restoration work this year. Congress needs to help us complete the world’s largest intergovernmental watershed restoration project ASAP! Good for Florida and good for the environment.

"The President has absolutely demonstrated no wrongdoing whatsoever & that the Special Counsel has no evidence of any wrongdoing. In other words it’s time to end this Witch Hunt." @LouDobbs   Russian "collusion" was just an excuse by the Democrats for having lost the Election!
Republicans shouldn’t vote for H.R. 312 a special interest casino Bill backed by Elizabeth (Pocahontas) Warren. It is unfair and doesn’t treat Native Americans equally!
The only thing keeping Tester alive is he has millions and millions of dollars from outside liberals and leftists who couldn’t care less about our Country!

Great progress on healthcare. Improvements being made - Republicans coming together!

Happy to announce I am nominating Alex Azar to be the next HHS Secretary. He will be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices!
Another big dropout of the Presidential race was along with 0% Tim Ryan 0% @RepSwalwell. Such talk and bravado from both and nothing to show. They stood for nothing and the voters couldn’t stand by them. Obnoxious and greedy politicians never make it in the end!

Our pathetic slow moving Federal Reserve headed by Jay Powell who raised rates too fast and lowered too late should get our Fed Rate down to the levels of our competitor nations. They now have as much as a two point advantage with even bigger currency help. Also stimulate!

Mini Mike is getting slammed. His debates were perhaps the worst in presidential debating history. A total phony who disavowed "Stop & Frisk" after swearing by it for years and even recently. He horribly overused it & then dropped when running as a Dem. A total phony!

.....I look forward to my meeting with Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi. In 2006 Democrats voted for a Wall and they were right to do so. Today they no longer want Border Security. They will fight it at all cost and Nancy must get votes for Speaker. But the Wall will get built...
....meeting with their top leaders and representatives today in the Oval Office. No final deal will be made until my friend President Xi and I meet in the near future to discuss and agree on some of the long standing and more difficult points. Very comprehensive transaction....
Democrats will have a unanimous vote on a 20% issue in opposing Republican Senators tomorrow. The Dems are for Open Borders and Crime!
...love to have Mike Pompeo Rick Perry Mick Mulvaney and many others testify about the phony Impeachment Hoax. It is a Democrat Scam that is going nowhere but future Presidents should in no way be compromised. What has happened to me should never happen to another President!
Congratulations to Andrew Gillum on having run a really tough and competitive race for Governor of the Great State of Florida. He will be a strong Democrat warrior long into the future - a force to reckon with!
The G-7 was a great success for the USA and all. LameStream Media coverage bore NO relationship to what actually happened in France - FAKE NEWS. It was GREAT!
Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of "Meet the Press" had a total meltdown in his interview with highly reaspected Senator @RonJohnsonWI. Seems that a not very bright Chuck just wasn’t getting the answers he was looking for in order to make me look as bad as possible. I did NOTHING wrong!
(Kiddingly) We’re building a Wall in Colorado"(then stated "we’re not building a Wall in Kansas but they get the benefit of the Wall we’re building on the Border") refered to people in the very packed auditorium from Colorado & Kansas getting the benefit of the Border Wall!
...dying newspaper industry. No matter how much they try to distract and cover it up our country is making great progress under my leadership and I will never stop fighting for the American people! As an example the failing New York Times...
"There is no underlying crime in that transcript." @IngrahamAngle  100% correct and the Whistleblower disappeared after I released the transcript of the call. Where is the Whistleblower? That is why this is now called the Impeachment Hoax! The Do Nothing Dems are Doing Nothing!
If Senate Republicans don't get rid of the Filibuster Rule and go to a 51% majority few bills will be passed. 8 Dems control the Senate!
So nice that our Country is now Energy Independent. The USA is in better shape than ever before. Strongest Military by far biggest Economy (no longer even close) number one in Energy! MAGA = KAG!
So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding...

Such a wonderful statement from the great @LouDobbs. "We take up what may be the most accomplished presidency in modern American history."
Walking into Madison Square Garden last night with @danawhite for the big @UFC Championship fight was a little bit like walking into a Trump Rally. Plenty of MAGA & KAG present. Great energy. Fantastic job Dana! Heading to D.C. and then to Kentucky for a big @MattBevin Rally...
No bedbugs at Doral. The Radical Left Democrats upon hearing that the perfectly located (for the next G-7) Doral National MIAMI was under consideration for the next G-7 spread that false and nasty rumor. Not nice!

Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also much easier & quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source!

The Governor of Louisiana John Bel Edwards has done a poor job. NOW HE IS IN A RUNOFF WITH A GREAT REPUBLICAN @EddieRispone. Thank you Louisiana! 66% down to 47% after I explained what a bad job the Governor was doing.
The least effective of our 53 Republican Senators and a person who truly doesn’t have what it takes to be great is Little Ben Sasse of Nebraska a State which I have gladly done so much to help. @SenSasse was as nice as a RINO can be until he recently won the Republican....
I will also be going to a wonderful state Missouri that I won by a lot in '16. Dem C.M. is opposed to big tax cuts. Republican will win S!
.....nice call with with the new President of Ukraine it could not have been better or more honorable and the Fake News Media and Democrats working as a team have fraudulently made it look bad. It wasn’t bad it was very legal and very good. A continuing Witch Hunt!

Our CoronaVirus Team has been doing a great job. Even Democrat governors have been VERY complimentary!
My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000 while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!

"Why did the Democrats run if they didn’t want to do things?" @SenRickScott
....The good news is that we are winning. Our real opponent is not the Democrats or the dwindling number of Republicans that lost their way and got left behind our primary opponent is the Fake News Media. In the history of our Country they have never been so bad!
China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries including the United States in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation but U.S. is taking in Billions!
.....on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall. Properly designed and built Walls work and the Democrats are lying when they say they don’t. In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful. Will not be any different on our Southern Border! Hundreds of $Billions saved!

Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
The economy is doing perhaps better than ever before and that’s prior to fixing some of the worst and most unfair Trade Deals ever made by any country. In any event they are coming along very well. Most countries agree that they must be changed but nobody ever asked!
Will be interviewed at the Border by @seanhannity on @FoxNews tonight at 9:00. Enjoy!
The Democrats would save many lives if they would change our broken and very DANGEROUS Immigration Laws. It can be done instantly!
....countries that know how to play the game against the U.S. That’s actually why the E.U. was formed....and for China until now the U.S. has been "easy pickens." The Fed has made all of the wrong moves. A small rate cut is not enough but we will win anyway!
....Democrats talking point is that we are doing badly. If the virus disappeared tomorrow they would say we did a really poor and even incompetent job. Not fair but it is what it is. So far by the way we have not had one death. Let’s keep it that way!
Director Clapper reiterated what everybody including the fake media already knows- there is "no evidence" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.

Thank you to Carmen Yulin Cruz the Mayor of San Juan for your kind words on FEMA etc.We are working hard. Much food and water there/on way
.....China has been taking advantage of the United States on Trade for many years. They also know that I am the one that knows how to stop it. There will be great and fast economic retaliation against China if our farmers ranchers and/or industrial workers are targeted!
Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U.S.A. Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers.

The Democrats are doing nothing on the Border to address the Humanitarian and National Security Crisis! Could be fixed so easily if they would vote with Republicans to fix the loopholes.

Wacky Omarosa already has a fully signed Non-Disclosure Agreement!
The ABC/Washington Post Poll was by far the least accurate one 2 weeks out from the 2016 Election. I call it a suppression poll - but by Election Day they brought us out of shame to about even. They will never learn!
Rather than causing a big disruption in N.Y.C. I will be working out of my home in Bedminster N.J. this weekend. Also saves country money!
....The conversation with the new and very good Ukraine President who told the Fake News at the United Nations that HE WAS NOT PRESSURED BY ME IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM should by and of itself bring an end to the new and most recent Witch Hunt. Others ended in ashes!
Good job I must say by Bob Woodward on "Deface the Nation." The CBS no name host(ess) and other guest Peter Baker of The Failing New York Times were totally biased boring and wrong (as usual) but Woodward was cool calm and interesting. Thank you Bob!

Congratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio. He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs.  His Socialist opponent in November should not do well a big failure in last job!
Wowthe Fake News media did everything in its power to make the Republican Healthcare victory look as bad as possible.Far better than Ocare!
Why is such a focus put on 2nd and 3rd hand witnesses many of whom are Never Trumpers or whose lawyers are Never Trumpers when all you have to do is read the phone call (transcript) with the Ukrainian President and see first hand? He and others also stated that there was.....

Doing great with China and other Trade Deals. The only problem we have is Jay Powell and the Fed. He’s like a golfer who can’t putt has no touch. Big U.S. growth if he does the right thing BIG CUT - but don’t count on him! So far he has called it wrong and only let us down....
Republicans & others must remember the Ukrainian President and Foreign Minister both said that there was no pressure placed on them whatsoever. Also they didn’t even know the money wasn’t paid and got the money with no conditions. But why isn’t Germany France (Europe) paying?

I am pleased to announce that it is my intention to nominate Christopher Waller Ph. D. Executive VP and Director of Research Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Missouri to be on the board of the Federal Reserve....
China just enacted a major stimulus plan. With all the Tariffs THEY are paying to the USA Billions and Billions of Dollars they need it! In the meantime our Federal Reserve sits back and does NOTHING!

Rasmussen was one of the most accurate polls in 2016. Actually I think based on Crowds and Enthusiasm (of which Sleepy Joe has none!) that we are MUCH higher than 51%. The only thing Joe can count on is that a Federal Judge doesn’t eviscerate the Fake Ballot Rigging Scam!

Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning.
....THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!
A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP NAFTA high taxes radical regulation and massive influx of refugees.
$55.15M will be on its way to @KYTC to widen @mtnparkway from two lanes to four lanes between the KY 191 overpass and the KY 205 interchange. Must keep the people of Kentucky moving efficiently and safely!

Just spoke to @LouDobbs. Will be doing a very interesting show tonight at 7:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxBusiness!
Sleep Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail and probably more. Joe doesn’t know anything about it he is clueless but they will be the real power not Joe. They will be calling the shots! Big tax increases for all Plus!
"The Democrats need more than this." @tombrokaw  Much more!
I will sign the first bill to repeal #Obamacare and give Americans many choices and much lower rates!
Hillary Clinton should not be given national security briefings in that she is a lose cannon with extraordinarily bad judgement & insticts.
Great news for Louisiana! $135M proposed to @La_DOTD from @USDOT to build 8.3 miles of elevated highway from Leeville Bridge to Golden Meadow to protect access to the area against flooding.

Big news for @EagleCounty Colorado! $60.7M proposed to @ColoradoDOT from @USDOT for improvements and enhanced safety to the Vail Pass on I-70 between miles 180-190. HUGE for safe travel through the region!
House Republicans should allow Chairs of Committees to remain for longer than 6 years. It forces great people and real leaders to leave after serving. The Dems have unlimited terms. While that has its own problems it is a better way to go. Fewer people in the end will leave!
REPEAL AND REPLACE!!! #ObamaCareInThreeWords
"The IG found that James Comey leaked Classified Documents to his attorneys which can be (is) a violation of the Espionage Act. This is consistent with all the lies that Comey has been spreading. @GreggJarrett  @ByronYork @LouDobbs
Melania and I extend our warmest greetings to those observing Rosh Hashanah here in the United States in Israel and around the world.
STOCK MARKET AT ALL-TIME HIGH! HOW ARE YOUR 409K’S DOING? 70% 80% 90% up? Only 50% up! What are you doing wrong?
....Sondland said Trump told him. None of this will move the needle for anyone. And now Dems in Swing Districts head home for Thanksgiving to hear from voters. Pelosi & Co. are putting on a show to appease the Democratic base instead of doing the work ALL Americans need done."
Hopefully the violence & unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end. To those injured get well soon. We need unity & leadership.
If @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform.
Congratulations to @foxandfriends on its unbelievable ratings hike.

The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar!
Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance. I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
.@JohnChrin of Pennsylvania is fantastic. He is strong on the Border Crime the Military our Vets and the 2nd Amendment. He is a powerful vote for #MAGA and loves the Great State of Pennsylvania. Please get out and vote for John he has my Total and very Strong Endorsement!
....(which is under siege) is strong on Crime and the Border and truly LOVES our Military and our Vets. He will be a great Senator for the people of Alabama. Coach Tommy Tuberville a winner has my Complete and Total Endorsement. I love Alabama!
...the Crown Prince. He is waiting for the results of the investigations being done by the Saudis and Turkey and just gave a news conference to that effect.
Why has nobody asked Kaine about the horrible views emanated on WikiLeaks about Catholics? Media in the tank for Clinton but Trump will win!
Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction terrorism and ISIS across the world.
Bus investments are in the works for the people of Nebraska! I’m sending $13.6M from @USDOT in federal infrastructure funds for improvements to bus service in Omaha. Great news!
Great things headed to Tennessee! $11.2M is headed to @myTDOT from @USDOT to install fiber optic communications on I-40 from Memphis to Nashville. This is HUGE for safety info and broadband in a lot of communities that need it!

I agree Mike - thank you to all of our law enforcement officers! #VPDebate "Police officers are the best of us..."@Mike_Pence
Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS rise of Iran and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression!
....a foreign power engaged in clandestine intelligence activities and yet they still asked for the renewal two more times and it gave the right for the government to rifle through the Trump campaigns files & Emails Text messages....." So how bad & illegal is that? @FoxNews
...The United States because of the Federal Reserve is paying a MUCH higher Interest Rate than other competing countries. They can’t believe how lucky they are that Jay Powell & the Fed don’t have a clue. And now on top of it all the Oil hit. Big Interest Rate Drop Stimulus!
....The problem is that the so-called Commission on Presidential Debates is stacked with Trump Haters & Never Trumpers. 3 years ago they were forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone in the first debate against Crooked Hillary. As President the debates are up...
In the last 24 hrs. we have raised over $13M from online donations and National Call Day and we’re still going! Thank you America! #MAGA
May God be with the people of Sutherland Springs Texas. The FBI and Law Enforcement has arrived.
Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here.
Previous quote from the great Republican Senator Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma - Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee
...."Nothing gives Schiff jurisdiction over Impeachment."
Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 9:00 P.M. Eastern on @FoxNews. Enjoy!
To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests we welcome you with open arms. People first.
We have a totally corrupt previous Administration including a President and Vice President who spied on my campaign AND GOT CAIGHT...and nothing happens to them. This crime was taking place even before my election everyone knows it and yet all are frozen stiff with fear....
Thank you Andrew. Meadow was watching and is so proud of her great father and family!

BIG thank you to Mac Thornberry (@MacTXPress) for a GREAT Defense Deal! Mac has been a champion for our Military and Vets his whole career and now he can add Space Force to his accomplishments. Look forward to another great defense bill next year Mac! @HASCRepublicans
Just spoke with @NYGovCuomo and @NYCMayor de Blasio to let them know that the federal government...

....and has been horrible on Virginia economy. Vote @EdWGillespie today!
Anna Wintour came to my office at Trump Tower to ask me to meet with the editors of Conde Nast & Steven Newhouse a friend. Will go this AM.
Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS under a serious emergency belongs!
....years or maybe 10 or 14 (just kidding) they will quickly go out of business for lack of credibility or approval from the public. That’s why they will all be Endorsing me at some point one way or the other. Could you imagine having Sleepy Joe Biden or @AlfredENeuman99..
DC’s @WMATA system is getting over $876M a big boost to stay open & operating! The federal funds will keep workers paid & buses & trains running on a limited schedule as they are needed for essential trips. Good news for those who rely on transit! Congrats to @MayorBowser & all!
....I have seen some of the regulations being circulated including those being contemplated by Congress and they are ridiculous. I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States not difficult. Everyone in my Administration is being so instructed with no excuses...
We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place.
Joe Biden is a Low Energy Candidate the likes of which we have never seen before. The last thing our country needs is a Low Energy Individulal especially when surrounded by High Energy Chess Players scattered all over the world. He’s back in his basement now - no schedule!
....price. You should drop out of the race & pray that super liberal @DougJones a weak & pathetic puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi & Cryin’ Chuck Schumer gets beaten badly. He voted for impeachment based on "ZERO". Disgraced Alabama. Coach @TTuberville will be a GREAT Senator!
President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie.
I’m proud to propose a $6.8M award to @WisconsinDOT from @USDOT to complete the last phase of the Merrimac Bridge rehabilitation – more efficient and lower cost rail car travel over Lake Wisconsin!

My daughter Ivanka will be on @trish_regan tonight on @FoxBusiness at 8:00 P.M. following the great @LouDobbs at 7:00. Enjoy!
The @nytimes story is a Fake just like the "paper" itself. I was criticized for moving too fast when I issued the China Ban long before most others wanted to do so. @SecAzar told me nothing until later and @PeterNavarroUSA memo was same as Ban (see his statements). Fake News!
....very often FAKE NEWS. Lamestream Media should be forced to reveal sources very much as they did in the long ago past. If they did that the media would be trusted again and Fake News would largely be a thing if the past!
The Great Rush Limbaugh will be on @foxandfriends at 8:30 A.M. Enjoy!
Thank you to Congressman Ben @Cline4Virginia for the Great remarks this morning on the illegitimate Impeachment Hoax. He understands the Do Nothing Democrats very well. Also and as usual @RepAndyBiggsAZ was fantastic!
"ECB officials see Rate Cut as primary tool for any new stimulus."  @business
.@RIDOTNews is set to be awarded $65 million from @USDOT to complete multiple safety improvements and repairs to the RI-246 corridor – greatly improving travel through the region!
...The Bob Woodward book will be a FAKE as always just as many of the others have been. But believe it or not lately I’ve been getting lots of GREAT books!
I won every poll from last nights Presidential Debate - except for the little watched @CNN poll.
Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.
1. Which country has the largest carbon emission reduction?AMERICA!2. Who has dumped the most carbon into the air?   CHINA!3. 91% of the world’s population are exposed to air pollution above the World Health Organization’s suggested level.   NONE ARE IN THE U.S.A.!
Thank you to everyone for all of the nice comments by Twitter pundits and otherwise for my speech last night.
Many people are saying that the Iranians killed the scientist who helped the U.S. because of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails.
"I think the Democrats are going to lose many members over this." @DebbieLesko @edhenry
The American people want LAW & ORDER — Joe Biden won’t even say those words!

Congratulations to the Kansas City Chiefs on a great game and a fantastic comeback under immense pressure. You represented the Great State of Kansas and in fact the entire USA so very well. Our Country is PROUD OF YOU!
Mark Esperanto Secretary of Defense "The ceasefire is holding up very nicely. There are some minor skirmishes that have ended quickly. New areas being resettled with the Kurds." USA soldiers are not in combat or ceasefire zones. We have secured the Oil. Bringing soldiers home!
.@SenCoryGardner has done a fantastic job representing the people of Colorado. He really knows how to win. Strong on Crime Borders & the 2nd A Cory fights hard for our Military & Vets. John Hickenlooper is badly damaged after his horrible run for President. Big Primary trouble!
....said "I’m going to clean up Washington I’m going to help people." He gave big tax cuts he’s made our military strong. They’re mad at him because he actually did what he said he was going to do. History will record we’re experiencing some of the best times we’ve ever.....
V.P. Mike Pence will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!
Just left a great rally in Florida - now heading to Ohio for two more. Will be there soon.
Great! @LouDobbs interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 9:00 P.M.  @FoxNews
....But they really want a do-over! You can’t investigate and legislate simultaneously - it just doesn’t work that way. You can’t go down two tracks at the same time. Let Chuck Nancy Jerry Adam and all of the rest finish playing their games....
My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County Arkansas. #LESM
BIG bucks heading to Illinois! $18.9M in federal infrastructure funds from @USDOT will be awarded to @ConnectTransit @CityLinkPeoria and @PaceSuburbanBus for improvements to bus service in the areas. Congratulations!

FEMA has been told directly by me to give the A Plus treatment to the Great State of Alabama and the wonderful people who have been so devastated by the Tornadoes. @GovIvey one of the best in our Country has been so informed. She is working closely with FEMA (and me!).
It was a really great day for America! A special evening tonight on @TuckerCarlson @seanhannity  & @IngrahamAngle Will be very interesting!

Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see.
So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe NOT China. This is a first! I wonder where the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs and obviously want back in. Sad!
Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forrest fires that with proper Forrest Management would never happen. Unless they get their act together which is unlikely I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!
Where are @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan and @Raul_Labrador?#RepealANDReplace #Obamacare
We will bring America together as ONE country again – united as Americans in common purpose and common dreams. #MAGA
Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past. She is totally confused. Unfit to serve as #POTUS.
....practically nothing. Both Senators became totally unelectable couldn’t come even close to winning their primaries and decided to drop out of politics and gracefully "RETIRE". @SenSasse could be next or perhaps the Republicans should find a new and more viable candidate?
It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people. Phony politicians!
My wife Melania will be interviewed tonight at 8:00pm by Anderson Cooper on @CNN. I have no doubt she will do very well. Enjoy!
Will be doing a News Conference live from the White House at 3:00 P.M. Eastern.

I am on @foxandfriends - Enjoy!

Violent crime is rising across the United States yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities.
My prayers are with the victims and hostages in the horrible Paris attacks. May God be with you all.
Just had a  very good tele-conference with Nations’s Governors. Went very well. Cuomo of New York has to "do more".

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary....that's really saying something!
Luther Strange has been shooting up in the Alabama polls since my endorsement. Finish the job - vote today for "Big Luther."
I find it offensive that Goofy Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas pretended to be Native American to get in Harvard.
....My co-chair in Utah and a really great guy. Sean has my Complete and Total Endorsement!
How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam which horribly oppresses women?
Has anyone noticed that the top shows on @foxnews and cable ratings are those that are Fair (or great) to your favorite President me! Congratulations to @seanhannity for being the number one shoe on Cable Television!

Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION!
President Obama & Putin fail to reach deal on Syria - so what else is new? Obama is not a natural deal maker. Only makes bad deals!
Russia Syria and Iran are killing or on their way to killing thousands if inocent civilians in Idlib Province. Don’t do it! Turkey is working hard to stop this carnage.
...Looks to be a Cat. 3 which is even more intense than Florence. Good news is the folks in the Pan Handle can take care of anything. @FEMA and First Responders are ready - be prepared! #HurricaneMichael
We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years. I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not.
The failed Fast Train project in California were the cost overruns are becoming world record setting is hundreds of times more expensive than the desperately needed Wall!
CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton.
Do you believe that Hillary Clinton now wants Obamacare for illegal immigrants? She should spend more time taking care of our great Vets!
ALABAMA get out and vote for Luther Strange - he has proven to me that he will never let you down! #MAGA
The situations in Tulsa and Charlotte are tragic. We must come together to make America safe again.
....They exonerated him completely of being an agent of Russia (Recently Crooked Hillary charged Tulsi Gabbard & Jill Stein with the same thing-SICK) and yet Mr. Comey still runs to the White House on February 14 and conjures up the Obstruction of Justice narrative against.....
Unbelievable evening. Just made a speech in front 17000 amazing New Yorkers in Bethpage Long Island--- great to be home!
Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan? Thousands of American lives lost. #MDW
Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods. #ImWithYou
Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton. The system is totally rigged. Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence?
Dwyane Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!
.@RepMcClintock  Thank you Tom. Great interview on @TeamCavuto! @FoxNews
Can you believe Crooked Hillary said "We are going to put a whole lot of coal miners&coal companies out of business." She then apologized.
People are coming from far and wide to join us today and tonight for what is turning out to be one of the biggest celebrations in the history of our Country SALUTE TO AMERICA an all day event at the Lincoln Memorial culminating with large scale flyovers of the most modern.....
Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats. This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI the Wendy Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails.
Vast numbers of manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania have moved to Mexico and other countries. That will end when I win!
Nancy Reagan the wife of a truly great President was an amazing woman. She will be missed!
The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam.
They laughed at me when I said to bomb the ISIS controlled oil fields. Now they are not laughing and doing what I said. #Trump2016
...This Bill HELPS students get the student aid they need to go to college! STOP the headaches and STOP the PAPERWORK barriers to HIGHER EDUCATION! Congrats to Lamar!
ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will. Not capable!
Thoughts and prayers to the great people of Indiana. You will prevail!
The Mainstream Media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today. FAKE NEWS is actually the biggest story of all and is the true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE! That’s why they refuse to cover the REAL Russia Hoax. But the American people are wise to what is going on.....
House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia. As I have been saying all along it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies. There should never have been a Special Councel appointed. Witch Hunt!
Our great Senator (and Star) from the State of Arkansas @TomCottonAR has just completed a wonderful book "Sacred Duty" about Arlington National Cemetary and the men and women who serve with such love and devotion. On sale today make it big!
I am in South Korea now. President Moon and I have "toasted" our new Trade Deal a far better one for us than that which it replaced. Today I will visit with and speak to our Troops - and also go the the DMZ (long planned). My meeting with President Moon went very well!

Thank you Washington! Honored to say on behalf of our great movement we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history.
....agricultural products from our Great Farmers in larger amounts than China ever did and ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance. In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!
Crooked Hillary just can't close the deal with Bernie. It will be the same way with ISIS and China on trade and Mexico at the border. Bad!
Lou Dobbs: "This cannot go forward...this Special Councel with all of his conflicts with his 17 Angry Democrats without any evidence of collusion by the Trump Campaign and Russia. The Dems are the ones who should be investigated." Thank you Lou so true!
CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime failing schools and vanishing jobs.
.@AnnCoulter's new book 'In Trump We Trust comes out tomorrow. People are saying it's terrific - knowing Ann I am sure it is!
I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate. I will defeat them both.
As I predicted 16 cities led mostly by Open Border Democrats and the Radical Left have filed a lawsuit in of course the 9th Circuit! California the state that has wasted billions of dollars on their out of control Fast Train with no hope of completion seems in charge!
I will be handing over my Twitter account to my team of deplorables for tonight's #debate#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.

Landing in New Hampshire soon to talk about the massive drug problem there and all over the country.

Mini Mike Bloomberg can never recover from his incompetent debate performances. Also as mayor he was very bad under pressure - a chocker!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective. Does nothing. All talk no action -- maybe her Native American name?
....fashioned but true. When you don’t need or want money you don’t need or want banks. Banks have always been available to me they want to make money. Fake Media only says this to disparage and always uses unnamed sources (because their sources don’t even exist)......
@marklevinshow Mark Levin: "We ought to talk about the substance of this phone call. We have the call I don’t know what we need witnesses for? Can’t we read English? Do I need a Whistleblower to tell me what I’m reading? Do I need a Lt. C. to tell me? NO." So plain and simple!

Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings. I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant!
Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration right up to January 20th why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Session!
Thank you Michigan! #Trump2016
For too many years our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs safety and protection for those in need.
Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska. Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant but leaves behind amazing legacy.
....got fired. Wrote a very nice book about me just recently. Now the book is a lie? Said his wife was driving him crazy "something big" was happening with her. Getting divorced. He was a mental wreck. We didn’t want him around. Now Fake News puts him on like he was my buddy!
No such meeting or conversation ever happened - a made up story by "low ratings" @CNN.
Thank you Hawaii! #Trump2016
Wacky @NYTimesDowd who hardly knows me makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column. A neurotic dope!
Probably the only thing Barack Obama and I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis the world’s most overrated General. I asked for his letter of resignation & felt great about. His nickname was "Chaos" which I didn’t like & changed it to "Mad Dog"...
The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!
Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do.

Goofy Elizabeth Warren Hillary Clinton’s flunky has a career that is totally based on a lie. She is not Native American.
...On Monday nearly 12.2 million people watched Mr. Trump’s briefing on CNN Fox News and MSNBC according to Nielsen — ‘Monday Night Football’ numbers. Millions more are watching on ABC CBS NBC and online streaming sites and the audience is expanding. On Monday Fox News...
The appointment of the Special Councel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL! Despite that we play the game because I unlike the Democrats have done nothing wrong!
EARLY VOTING: MN & IA already underway more states coming up in the next week: OH ME AZ IN — check w/local officials for details & VOTE!
....The process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars. The U.S. only sells China approximately 100 Billion Dollars of goods & products a very big imbalance. With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in we will buy.....
Thank you Mississippi! #Trump2016
Congratulations to @seanhannity on his tremendous increase in television ratings. Speaking of ratings- I will be on his show tonight @ 10pE.
I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx. $50 million loan. I have totally terminated the loan!
The @WashingtonPost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories. Don't buy boring!
As a tribute to the late great Phyllis Schlafly I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP.
Wow! Just got word that our June 18th Tuesday ANNOUNCEMENT in Orlando Florida already has 74000 requests for a 20000 seat Arena. With all of the big events that we have done this tickets looks to be the "hottest" of them all. See you in Florida!
Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada!
As Bernie Sanders said Hillary Clinton has bad judgement. Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary!
Crazy Maureen Dowd the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes pretends she knows me well--wrong!
Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American. I say she’s a fraud!
Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?
Thank you West Virginia. Let's keep it going. Go out and vote on Tuesday - we will win big. #Trump2016
Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria Iraq and Libya. She is reckless and dangerous!
@KimStrassel "Schiff’s surveillance (obtaining phone logs) is an unprecedented abuse of power."  To put it mildly. Also it is illegal!
I only wish my wonderful daughter Tiffany could have been with us at Mar-a-Lago for our great election victory. She is a winner!
....Average hourly wages growth has far outpaced what we saw with President Obama. Across all industries from mining and construction to leisure & hospitality With President Trump we see income growth in states like Iowa Ohio Pennsylvania Wisconsin Nevada Florida......
It has been two years since the tragedy in Parkland. We will always mourn the innocent lives taken from us – 14 wonderful students and 3 terrific educators. Earlier this week I met with families whose experiences from that horrible day still piece the soul....
SLEEPY JOE BIDEN IS PROPOSING THE BIGGEST TAX HIKE IN OUR COUNTRIES HISTORY! CAN ANYBODY REALLY VOTE FOR THIS?
Wow Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania not enough signatures. Big problem!
I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes but when I won the GOP nomination I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!
Why isn’t the FBI giving Andrew McCabe text massages to Judicial Watch or appropriate governmental authorities. FBI said they won’t give up even one (I may have to get involved DO NOT DESTROY). What are they hiding? McCabe wife took big campaign dollars from Hillary people......
Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto.
The #SOTU speech is really boring slow lethargic - very hard to watch!

We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio. No way to run a country!
The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people. I have 73 Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her.
@nytimes "The Votes Were A Resounding Victory For Mr. Trump." True but the Impeachment Hoax was just a continuation of the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats corrupt practices!
Cruz came to Mississippi there was nobody there he left the state. I had a rally in Madison MS with 10000! Thank you!
Great job by @EricTrump on interview with @BillHemmer on @FoxNews. #ImWithYou #TrumpTrain
The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign. Done deal!
I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local!

The Republican platform is most pro-Israel of all time!
These politicians like Cruz and Graham who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years do nothing to make things better!
Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!
Theresa @theresamay don’t focus on me focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine!
The incompetent Mayor of London Sadique Kahn was bothered that I played a very fast round of golf yesterday. Many Pols exercise for hours or travel for weeks. Me I run through one of my courses (very inexpensive). President Obama would fly to Hawaii. Kahn should focus on....

Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night. The problem is he is a choker and once a choker always a choker! Mr. Meltdown.
Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost!
If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act stop cheating & doing negative ads I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen.
.@megynkelly- I am in Nevada. Sorry to inform you Kellyanne is in the audience. Better luck next time.
The Fake News has never been more dishonest than it is today. Thank goodness we can fight back on Social Media. There new weapon of choice is Fake Polling sometimes referred to as Suppression Polls (they suppress the numbers). Had it in 2016 but this is worse.........
Just another desperate move by the man who should have easily beaten Barrack Obama. (2/2)

Now the press is trying to sell the fact that I wanted a Moot stuffed with alligators and snakes with an electrified fence and sharp spikes on top at our Southern Border. I may be tough on Border Security but not that tough. The press has gone Crazy. Fake News!
Spoke to President Maithripala Sirisena of Sri Lanka yesterday to inform him that the United States stands by him and his country in the fight against terrorism. Also expressed condolences on behalf of myself and the People of the United States.

Just leaving Salt Lake City Utah- fantastic crowd with no interruptions. Love Utah- will be back!
I will be interviewed by @jessebwatters on @oreillyfactor tonight at 8pm. Enjoy!
....His primary strength was not military but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life things to do and battles to win but he seldom "brought home the bacon". I didn’t like his "leadership" style or much else about him and many others agree. Glad he is gone!
I am watching two clown announcers on @FoxNews as they try to build up failed presidential candidate #LittleMarco. Fox News is in the bag!

The Washington Post is constantly quoting "anonymous sources" that do not exist. Rarely do they use the name of anyone because there is no one to give them the kind of negative quote that they are looking for. They are a discgrace to journalism but then again so are many others!
....product and goods to China and other countries. That’s what trade is all about. We don’t want to make it impossible to do business with us. That will only mean that orders will go to someplace else. As an example I want China to buy our jet engines the best in the World....
"Biden would be America’s Dream Candidate because there would be no more Tariffs no more demands that China stop stealing our IP things would go back to the old days with America’s manufacturers & workers getting shafted. He has Zero Credibility!" @IngrahamAngle  So true!
Why haven't they released the final Missouri victory for us yet? Could it be because Cruz's guy runs Missouri?
.@HeyTammyBruce- Thank you for your nice words on Fox today. They never use my full statements on nuclear which you would agree with!
I meet and talk to "foreign governments" every day. I just met with the Queen of England (U.K.) the Prince of Whales the P.M. of the United Kingdom the P.M. of Ireland the President of France and the President of Poland. We talked about "Everything!" Should I immediately.....
@HeyTammyBruce "This seems personal. That it is deeply unfair that has not changed. This has become a matter of their unhinged emotional reaction to a man who has bettered them who has had victory where they have not had victory and has exposed the problem with the Leftists."

Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage. Not presidential material!
So sad to see what is happening in New York where Governor Cuomo and Mayor DeBlasio are letting out 900 Criminals some hardened and bad onto the sidewalks of our rapidly declining because of them city. The Radical Left Dems are killing our cities. NYPD Chief is resigning!
.@MittRomney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked! Romney is a total joke and everyone knows it!
Iran humiliated the United States with the capture of our 10 sailors. Horrible pictures & images. We are weak. I will NOT forget!
Democrats are blocking a 251 Million Dollar funding boost for Small Businesses which will help them keep their employees. It should be for only that reason with no additions. We should have a big Infrastructure Phase Four with Payroll Tax Cuts & more. Big Economic Bounceback!

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney is having a news conference tomorrow to criticize me. (1/2)

They don't like Rubio in Florida- he left them high & dry. Doesn't even show up for votes!
The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud!
Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers!
Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina it's over. He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide!
They professionally managed so-called "protesters" at the White House had little to do with the memory of George Floyd. They were just their to cause trouble. The @SecretService handled them easily. Tonight I understand is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???

....Trump is doing to China is not lost on the rest of the world. Europe has had among the most protectionist policies forever. They’re sitting there and saying gee are we next? Maybe you are! We’ve got to change the rules. The U.S. can’t defend the world and pay for it........
Nervous Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace to herself and her family for having made such a disgusting statement especially since I was with foreign leaders overseas. There is no evidence for such a thing to have been said. Nervous Nancy & Dems are getting Zero work done in Congress...

Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts!
Public opinion has turned strongly against the Rigged Witch Hunt and the "Special" Councel because the public understands that there was no  Collusion with Russia (so ridiculous) that the two FBI lovers were a fraud against our Nation & that the only Collusion was with the Dems!
How can @JebBush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the #GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can!

@jimcramer "This is the best number I’ve ever seen in my life."
Once again #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly.
Prior to the end of the year I will be traveling to Israel. I am very much looking forward to it.
.@GlennBeck got fired like a dog by #Fox. The Blaze is failing and he wanted to have me on his show. I said no - because he is irrelevant.
I have asked Secretary of State @MikePompeo4USA to closely study the South Africa land and farm seizures and expropriations and the large scale killing of farmers. "South African Government is now seizing land from white farmers." @TuckerCarlson  @FoxNews
I would love to be at the Cadillac World Golf Championship @TrumpDoral in Miami- but even more so in Orlando with the #TrumpTrain!
To the people of Kentucky Rand Paul didn't want you. Now he runs back due to his presidential failure. #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

"It’s about peace and Properity that’s how Republican Presidents get elected and this President has delivered on the Economy and he’s delivered on keeping America Stronger and Safer. Our biggest enemy is not any one of these Democrats it’s the Media." John McLaughlin pollster
.@troybalderson is doing a great job as Congressman from Ohio. We need him in D.C. Vote for Troy - He has my total Endorsement!
Based on @MegynKelly's conflict of interest and bias she should not be allowed to be a moderator of the next debate.
Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also much easier & quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source!
After @TrumpTurnberry I will be visiting Aberdeen the oil capital of Europe to see my great club @TrumpScotland.
Just left Columbus rally of 14000 people --- a far bigger crowd than even I expected! Unbelievable evening incredible spirit in the arena!
....followed and then it was withdrawn. The Democrats argument for impeachment has not gotten stronger over the last few weeks. As Senator Josh Hawley just said he’s going to enter a Motion to Dismiss the Impeachment Trial because it’s never actually been brought to trial."
Remember get TIME magazine! I am on the cover. Take it out in 4 years and read it again! Just watch...
Failed presidential candidate @MittRomney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns until 9/21/12.
Daniel Cameron who just won the A.G. race in the Great Commonwealth of Kentucky is a young and very talented political star. You will be hearing much from Cameron in the yesrs to come!
Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars. I told them no and now they are doing negative ads.
@TeamCavuto  It was a 3 day train ride to Vietnam not 3 hours!

.....deficiencies and mistakes in NAFTA greatly opens markets to our Farmers and Manufacturers reduce Trade Barriers to the U.S. and will bring all three Great Nations closer together in competition with the rest of the world. The USMCA is a historic transaction!
I will replace it with private plans health savings accounts & allow purchasing across state lines. Maximum choice & freedom for consumer.
Word is that crying @GlennBeck left the GOP and doesn't have the right to vote in the Republican primary. Dumb as a rock.
I will be interviewed by Anderson Cooper at 8pm on @CNN from New Hampshire. Should be very interesting!

I'd like to call JEB a liar but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2)
I want to thank the people of Iowa for an unbelievable day. The crowds were amazing. Will be back Tuesday!
Our great country has been divided for decades. Sometimes you need protest in order to heel & we will heel & be stronger than ever before!

Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration.
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money.
"They’re trying to turn what was a Biden scandal into a Trump scandal." @PeterScheeizer The problem is "Trump" did nothing wrong!
The RNC which is probably not on my side just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.
....Sondland said Trump told him. None of this will move the needle for anyone. And now Dems in Swing Districts head home for Thanksgiving to hear from voters. Pelosi & Co. are putting on a show to appease the Democratic base instead if doing the work ALL Americans need done."
Congressman @DenverRiggleman of the 5th District in Virginia is a popular guy who really knows how to get the job done! Really big help with Tax Cuts the Military and our great Vets. He has my Total Endorsement!
If you listened to the flawed advice of @paulkrugman at the @nytimes a newspaper that was going broke until I came along you would have entirely missed the RECORD BREAKING Stock Market (and other) numbers produced since Election Day 2016. Sorry those are the FACTS....
"The speed bump has been missteps by the Federal Reserve." @CharlesPayne2nd  @foxandfriends  So true!
.@HillaryClinton is on the front page of the @nytimes waving to 200 people in New Hampshire. My crowd next door was 5000 people – no pic!
Going to Ohio home of one of the worst presidential candidates in history--Kasich. Can't debate loves #ObamaCare--dummy!
Melania and I were treated very nicely yesterday in Pittsburgh. The Office of the President was shown great respect on a very sad and solemn day. We were treaty so warmly. Small protest was not seen by us staged far away. The Fake News stories were just the opposite-Disgraceful!
I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare including the mandate period.
Heading to Baton Rouge Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
I allowed White House Counsel Don McGahn and all other requested members of the White House Staff to fully cooperate with the Special Councel. In addition we readily gave over one million pages of documents. Most transparent in history. No Collusion No Obstruction. Witch Hunt!
Respected Morning Consult poll just out. I lead all Republicans and beat Hillary head to head by a wide margin- 45 to 40!
Great even in SC tonight! Fire Marshall would not let everyone in-- 5000 turned away. Thank you for coming!
@SenateGOP Highest Trump Poll Numbers EVER! Thank you!
Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution which naturally they did not get.
"Palin’s brand among evangelicals is as gold as the faucets in Trump tower" said Ralph Reed the chairman of the Faith & Freedom Coalition.
Mark Penn  "Why are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff? Why is there an Independent Councel? To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses...Constitution was set up to prevent this...Stormtrooper tactics almost." A disgrace!
Joe Hiden’ get off his airplane grabs and shakes a rather stunned man’s hand (like in the old days) then touches his (Joe’s) face and mask with the same hand. No crowd no enthusiasm for Joe today. Law & Order!

Joe Biden has no plan for Coronavirus - ALL TALK! He was a disaster in his handling oh H1N1 Swine Flu. He didn’t have a clue with his own Chief of Staff so saying. If he were in charge perhaps 2.2 million people would have died from this much more lethal disease!
Congratulations to my friend @TheSlyStallone on winning a #GoldenGlobe. A wonderful guy- who has created something special- well deserved!
Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St
....State which I will win in #2020 because they can’t stand her and her hatred of our Country and they appreciate all that I have done for them (opening up mining and MUCH more) which has led to the best employment & economic year in Minnesota’s long and beautiful history!
National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way. It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low. Sad!
.@lindseygraham who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.
I hope all workers demand that their @Teamsters reps endorse Donald J. Trump. Nobody knows jobs like I do! Don’t let them sell you out!
I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy!
Rumor has it - Pataki Kasich & Senator Lindsey Graham are dropping out of the race very soon. Hope it's not true they're so easy to beat!
If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage?
Heading to South Carolina really big crowd! Will be back in New Hampshire tomorrow.#MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House. Melanie is feeling and doing really well. Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes!
Congressman Steve Stivers of Ohio has done a fantastic job as Chairman of the @NRCC. He is a great Congressman who is tough on crime & borders & an inspiration to our Military & Vets. Big on 2nd Amendment. Get out and vote for Steve on Aug 7th. He has my full & total endorsement!
The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times. Very few listeners - sad!
Alex Baldwin whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL now says playing DJT was agony for him. Alex it was also agony for those who were forced to watch. You were terrible. Bring back Darrell Hammond much funnier and a far greater talent!
Everybody that loves the people of New York and all they have been thru should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics!
Brian Kemp who is running for Governor of Georgia and has my full endorsement is campaigning tonight with @MikePenceVP. Brian is very strong on Crime and Borders LOVES our Military Vets and the 2nd Amendment. He will be a GREAT Governor!
.@EricTrump- unbelievable job on #FoxNews with @greta. That was better than I could do! #Trump2016
Dan Bishop was down 17 points 3 weeks ago. He then asked me for help we changed his strategy together and he ran a great race. Big Rally last night. Now it looks like he is going to win. @CNN & @MSNBC are moving their big studio equipment and to talent out. Stay tuned!
No @JebBush you’re pathetic for saying nothing happened during your brother’s term when the World Trade Center was attacked and came down.
For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged" bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM
....& overwhelming" but this Scam Impeachment was neither. Also very unfair with no Due Process proper representation or witnesses. Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans weren’t alowed to have in the House. Dems want to run majority Republican Senate. Hypocrites!
Totally unauthorized do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain
.@JebBushAt the debate you said your brother kept us safe- I wanted to be nice & did not mention the WTC came down during his watch 9/11.

I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions. I will eliminate the law in its entirety & replace it w/ something much better.
Thoughts & prayers with everyone in Lafayette Louisiana this evening.
I'm protesting the @UnionLeader from having anything to do w/ ABC debate. Their unethical record doesn't give them the right to be involved!
"There are 31 House Democrats in Trump won Congressional Districts. Those Dems will have to answer to their constituents come 2020. If you look at the facts there’s no crime there’s no witness there’s no evidence there’s no victim President Zelensky said there was.......
.@FoxNews owes me an apology for allowing clueless pundit @RichLowry to use such foul language on TV. Unheard of!
Is Cruz honest? He is in bed w/ Wall St. & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi low interest loans. No legal disclosure & never sold off assets.
When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him.
I'm going to be live with @ericbolling and @kimguilfoyle to ring in the New Year 2016. Everybody should tune in to @foxnews tomorrow night!
....product and goods to China and other countries. That’s what trade is all about. We don’t want to make it impossible to do business with us. That will only mean that orders will go to someplace else. As an example I want China to buy our jet engines the best in the World....
Thank you @JakeTapper for giving me credit for my vision on bombing the oil fields. Should have been done long ago. #Trump2016
While I very much appreciate P.M. Abe going to Iran to meet with Ayatollah Ali Khamenei I personally feel that it is too soon to even think about making a deal. They are not ready and neither are we!
Just left a great event in Pella. Going to church tomorrow in Muscatine Iowa.
I hope @TGowdySC does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings which were a total disaster for Republicans & America!

Just left Oklahoma--- the most amazing crowd and people! What a night!
New CNN Iowa poll --- Trump 33 Cruz 20. Everyone else way down! Don't trust Des Moines Register poll- biased towards Trump!
On my way to South Carolina. Big Crowd--- look forward to it!
Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize but not how to lead.
....because he doesn't live there! He wants to raise taxes & kill healthcare. On Tuesday #VoteKarenHandel.
Cruz lies are almost as bad as Jeb's. These politicians will do anything to stay at the trough!

If you listened to the flawed advice of @paulkrugman at the @nytimes a newspaper that was going broke until I came along you would have entirely missed the RECORD BREAKING Stock Market (and other) numbers produced since Election Day 2016. Sorry those are the FACTS....
Thank you to @Franklin_Graham. I have always appreciated your courage but now more so than ever!
Really disgusting that the failing New York Times allows dishonest writers to totally fabricate stories.
From 2% to 27% in Texas - quite a jump into first place!
.@BrentBozell one of the National Review lightweights came to my office begging for money like a dog. Why doesn't he say that?
With Caravans marching through Mexico and toward our Country Republicans must be prepared to do whatever is necessary for STRONG Border Security. Dems do nothing. If there is no Wall there is no Security. Human Trafficking Drugs and Criminals of all dimensionns - KEEP OUT!
.@williebosshog such an honor to get your endorsement. You are a fantastic guy! It will not be forgotten. Don and Eric say hello!
Alan Dershowitz Harvard Law Professor: "It all proves that we never needed a Special Councel....All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept. Don’t need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone’s back. Not the way Justice should operate." So true!
How is Chris Christie running the state of NJ which is deeply troubled when he is spending all of his time in NH? New Jerseyans not happy!
A really big show tonight by @seanhannity  9:00 P.M. @FoxNews  Heavy emphasis on the Impeachment Hoax. The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats have gone crazy. They know it’s a con but just can’t sell it! Public strongly against Impeachment.
Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on? Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada?
Thank you for the kind words tonight @OMAROSA. You were great! See you soon!
Cruz going down fast in recent polls- dropping like a rock. Lies never work!
Ted Cruz is a nervous wreck. He is making reckless charges not caring for the truth! His poll #'s are way down!
....BUT THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
New Day on CNN treats me very badly. @AlisynCamerota is a disaster. Not going to watch anymore.
I will be interviewed by Chris Wallace on Fox tomorrow morning. Tune in!
Congratulations to @jdickerson of Face the Nation on his highest ratings in 15 years. 4.6 million people watched my interview! Thank you!

Heading now to Pella Iowa. Big crowd! Remember Trump is a big buyer of Pella windows. See you soon!
Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
....BUT THE BEST IS YET TO COME!
Just found out I won the Rockingham County Republican Booth Straw Poll at the Deerfield Fair in New Hampshire this past weekend. 39% ---Wow!
(1/2) Time Magazine has me on the cover this week. David Von Drehle has written one of the best stories I have ever had.
Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo' the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison? ....
Huge crowd expected tomorrow night! VT Police say first come first serve. Arrive early!
Dope Frank Bruni said I called many people including Karl Rove losers-true! I never called my friend @HowardStern a loser- he’s a winner!
Two Tweets missing from last batch probably a Twitter error. No time for a redo! Only the Dems get redos!
Wow! Big pushback on Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York for his really dumb statement about America’s lack of greatness. I have already MADE America Great Again just look at the markets jobs military- setting records and we will do even better. Andrew "chocked" badly mistake!
Just received a copy of @SarahPalinUSA new book -- a great read! Sarah is a terrific person.
Marco Rubio is a total lightweight who I wouldn’t hire to run one of my smaller companies - a highly overrated politician!
I’m in the Oval Office. Democrats come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 3013. One more yes but with me in office I’ll get it built and Fast!
....guilty even on a civil bases. Those charges were just agreed to by him in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence which he did-including the fact that his family was temporarily let off the hook. As a lawyer Michael has great liability to me!
Incompetent @RichLowry lost it tonight on @FoxNews. He should not be allowed on TV and the FCC should fine him!
Highly untalented Wash Post blogger Jennifer Rubin a real dummy never writes fairly about me. Why does Wash Post have low IQ people?

Can you believe the worst Mayor in the U.S. & probably the worst Mayor in the history of #NYC @BilldeBlasio just called me a blow hard!
A wonderful afternoon in Iowa! Great people! Heading now to Florida - tomorrow South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth people realized he was a complete & total dud!
I am on @foxandfriends now! Tune in!
Just left Sioux Center Iowa. My speech was very well received. Truly great people! Packed house- overflow!
.....with a President and Federal Government that wants our wonerful City and State to flourish and thrive. I Love New York!
I will be on State of the Union @CNN with @jaketapper at 9am. Enjoy!
.@BilldeBlasio should focus on running #NYC & all of the problems that he has caused with his ineptitude & not be so focused on me!
Will be on Meet the Press with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning. Enjoy!
I truly understood the appeal of Ron Paul but his son @RandPaul didn't get the right gene.
.@jessebwatters You did a great job hosting @oreillyfactor. Everybody loved it! Thank you for the nice words.
Tom Ridge is a failed 'Bushy' & PA Governor. Him & his friend @KarlRove shouldn't be allowed to do their bias commentary- nobody listens!
I had thousands join me in New Hampshire last night! @HillaryClinton had 68. The #SilentMajority is fed up with what is going on in America!
The great people of New Hampshire who I love are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper.
"Taken for Granted" a wonderful new book by Gianni Caldwell on how Conservatism can win back the Americans that Liberalism Failed. Full Endorsement!
"Stock had the Best First Half since 1997." @WallStreetJour  Our Country is doing great - the talk of the world!
Just landed in the Philippines after a great day of meetings and events in Hanoi Vietnam!
.@RinglingBros is retiring their elephants-- the circus will never be the same.
John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!
This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates. I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed.
NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy
John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!
.@MonicaCrowley you were great with @SeanHannity on @FoxNews tonight.  Thank you for your kind words. We will keep Americans safe.
So professional of @ABC news to throw out the failing @UnionLeader newspaper from their debate. Paper won't survive highly unethical!
If their highly unethical behavior including begging me for ads isn’t questionable enough they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win.
Will be on @jimmykimmel in 20 minutes on @ABC. #Kimmel #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Leaving now for New Hampshire. Big crowd- looking forward to it! #FITN
John Kasich despite being Governor of Ohio is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!

News Conference at 5:45. Enjoy!
Again the President of the Ukraine said THERE WAS NO (ZERO) PRESSURE PUT ON HIM BY ME. End of case!

Thank you @BillKristol. I am going to Make America Great Again!
Will be on @jimmykimmel tonight at 11:35pmE on @ABC. #Kimmel #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
I will be on @cbs @60minutes this Sunday. A great honor-- hope you enjoy it.
I am greatly honored by the results of the CNN poll in Iowa. In the end I believe the final results will be even better than that!
Does anyone notice how the Montana Congressional race was such a big deal to Dems & Fake News until the Republican won? V was poorly covered
James Clapper who famously got caught lying to Congress is now an authority on Donald Trump. Will he show you his beautiful letter to me?
Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads lunches donations speeches from me and tweets---very unethical.
Wow the MSM is really going after me. 12000 in Sarasota a love fest hardly a mention. Only one negativity - they only want negatives!
Great job on Fox this morning @KatiePavlich. I am sending out for your book immediately. Thank you very much!
With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it?
.@MatthewJDowd thank you for the nice comments recently especially on @BarbaraJWalters. My family & I greatly appreciate your kind words.
Why doesn't @CNN use the #CNN Iowa poll? @andersoncooper @andydean2014

.....Ahead of schedule and under budget! Will be in Oklahoma tonight!
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates but it was easy—he came in dead last!
So let’s get this straight! There was No Collusion and in fact the Phony Dossier was a Con Job that was paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC. So the 13 Angry Democrats were investigating an event that never happened and that was in fact a made up Fraud. I just fought back....
So now the Fake News @nytimes is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs and obviously want back in. Sad!
The dying @UnionLeader newspaper in NH is in turmoil over my comments about them- like a bully that got knocked out!
To show you how politicians act Bobby Jindal spent $1000 to register in New Hampshire & dropped out the next day. Such a waste!
I find that @Reuters is a far more professional operation than @AP.
Thank you @SeanHannity & @BoDiet! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he’s almost last.
Getting ready to address the Farm Convention today in Nashville Tennessee. Love our farmers love Tennessee - a great combination! See you in a little while.
Marco Rubio is totally weak on illegal immigration & in favor of easy amnesty. A lightweight choker - bad for #USA!
Thank you @hardball_chris for your nice words. They are very much appreciated. I fully understand that you really get it.
There is no political necessity to keep Canada in the new NAFTA deal. If we don’t make a fair deal for the U.S. after decade of abuse Canada will be out. Congress should not interfere with these negotiations or I will simply terminate NAFTA entirely & we will be far better off..
My friend @AriEmanuel of @IMG bought the Miss Universe pageants from me and they are on tonight on #Fox! Tune in!
Gov. John Kasich has really failed on the campaign trail. I thought he would have been far more talented. He is just wasting time & money!
.@MarcoRubio is weak on illegal immigration and will allow anyone into the country.....
I am having a great time in Iowa at Jack Trice Stadium! Unbelievable people.
Karen Handle's opponent in #GA06 can't even vote in the district he wants to represent....
.@JonahNRO watched on @seanhannity and appreciate your statements --- I have been waiting for them for a long time. Thank you.
Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate!
....THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!
Never get good #'s from failing Des Moines Register/Bloomberg. I think something's going on w/them. Up 13 in IA according to respected CNN.
.....Has worst attendance record in Senate- rarely there to vote on a bill! @marcorubio
@MarkBurnettTV @RealRomaDowney From Bush 1 to present our Country has lost more than 55000 factories 6000000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars. Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars. Bad policies & leadership. Must win again!  #MAGA
I will be on @SeanHannity tonight at 10pmE talking about my new book #CrippledAmerica and much more! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me.
I will unveil my first campaign ads on @Morning_Joe at 6:30am tomorrow. Enjoy! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
@TrueTheVote There is a group of people (largely Radical Left Democrats) that want ELECTION MAYHEM. States must end this CRAZY mass sending of Ballots. Also a GIFT to foreign interference into our election!!! Stop it now before it is too late.
Loved being in Manassas VA last night. Such incredible spirit! Now in DC for a speech will then visit Old Post Office under construction.
The failing @politico news outlet which I hear is losing lots of money is really dishonest!
.@ColinCowherd said such nice things about me during the debate that I thought I'd do his show @TheHerd on Monday (2:30pm EST).
What is Frank VanderSloot getting for agreeing to back Marco Rubio? Last victim was Mitt Romney - see how that turned out.
Marco Rubio couldn't even respond properly to President Obama's State of the Union Speech without pouring sweat & chugging water. He choked!
.@JebBush is totally lost -- he spends too much time managing the bloated staff of his campaign & not enough talking about America's future.
.@politico which is not read or respected by many may be the most dishonest of the media outlets--- and that is saying something.
.@PatrickBuchanan was great on @TeamCavuto @FoxNews. Thank you Pat! #Tump2016
@NHC_Atlantic
Great to see the construction of the Old Post Office on Penn Ave. Going fast - under budget ahead of schedule!
.@scottienhughes - you were fantastic on CNN. Thank you for the nice words. See you at the #GOPDebate.
I will be on @CNNSitRoom with @wolfblitzer from 5-7pm est. on @CNN.
Dishonest @politico just called to say that none of the polls including Fox NBC CNN Zogby & Morning Consult matter. Serious haters.
.@ChuckTodd just informed us that my interview last week on @MeetthePress was their highest rated show in 4 years. Congrats!
Join me Tuesday Nov. 3rd at 12 PM in #TrumpTower in NYC. I'll be signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!
Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the @UnionLeader. It's a loser and my comments haven't helped him much.
Lightweight Senator @RandPaul should focus on trying to get elected in Kentucky--- a great state which is embarrassed by him.
It's too bad so few people showed up to @bobvanderplaats Family Leader dinner. Next year I'll try & be there- and they'll have a huge crowd!
A woman who got fired after two days of working with Scott Walker - a wacko - now trying to raise funds to fight me.
Governor Kasich whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls is going to spend $2.5 million against me.
.@SteveScalese blew the nasty & obnoxious Chris Wallace (will never be his father Mike!) away on Chris’s lowest rated (unless I’m on) morning show. This kind of dumb and unfair interview would never have happened in the @FoxNews past. Great job Steve!
Great job on @Greta @DonaldJTrumpJr. Nobody could have done it better!
....agricultural products from our Great Farmers in larger amounts than China ever did and ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance. In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!
....The process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars. The U.S. only sells China approximately 100 Billion Dollars of goods & products a very big imbalance. With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in we will buy.....
On @FallonTonight with @jimmyfallon at 11:30 PM. Enjoy!
Another great accolade for @TrumpGolf. Highly respected Golf Odyssey- awarded @TrumpDoral Blue Monster with best redesign. Thank you!
Also tune in to the @TodayShow at 7:00am. I will be on to discuss the campaign my new ads and #CrippledAmerica.
I will not be able to attend the Miss USA pageant tomorrow night because I am campaigning in Phoenix. Wishing all well!
Looking forward to press conference on taxes at 11AM at @TrumpTowerNY.
....If we bought 15 Billion Dollars of Agriculture from our Farmers far more than China buys now we would have more than 85 Billion Dollars left over for new Infrastructure Healthcare or anything else. China would greatly slow down and we would automatically speed up!
Will be interviewed by @SeanHannity on @foxnews at 10PM tonight. Enjoy!
Thank you @CarlHigbie. Great work on @CNN. #Trump2016
Yesterday was another big day for jobs and the Stock Market. Chrysler coming back to U.S. (Michigan) from Mexico and many more companies paying out Tax Cut money to employees. If Dems won in November Market would have TANKED! It was headed for disaster.
Carson now admits his friend named "Bob" who he tried to stab (Bob was saved by his belt buckle!) no longer exists as Bob. Wrong name!
If you like automobils how can you vote for a Democrat who all want to get rid of cars as quickly as possible especially if they are powered by gasoline. Remember also no more than one car per family. I on the other hand have new plants being built all over Michigan Plus!
....absolutely no pressure. I don’t know of any crime that was committed where the actual victim wasn’t aware of it....and they got the call they got the meeting and they got the money. Unbelievably the Democrats have weaponized the Impeachment process they have...
....our great police are being disrespected even with water dumped on them because a Mayor and Governor just don’t "have their backs." New York’s Finest must be cherished respected and loved. Too many prople are leaving our special New York. Great leaders would work....
I will be on @Morning_Joe live from New Hampshire tomorrow at 7am. #Trump2016 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
.@Erik_Paulsen @Jason2CD @JimHagedornMN and @PeteStauber love our Country and the Great State of Minnesota. They are winners and always get the job done We need them all in Congress for #MAGA. Border Military Vets 2nd A. Go Vote Minnesota. They have my Strong Endorsement!
With the fantastic ratings last weekend @meetthepress & @ThisWeekABC I think it’s only fair that I go on @FoxNewsSunday w/ Chris Wallace.
Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also much easier & quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source!
Great reception in D.C. At the Values Voter Summit. Now checking on my job at the Old Post Office...
Thank you for your nice words @MikeNeedham @Heritage for the nice words on @FoxNewsSunday with Chris Wallace. #FNS #Trump2016
I will be on @OutFrontCNN with @ErinBurnett at 7PM. Tune in!#Trump2016
.@marcorubio what do you say to the family of Kathryn Steinle in CA who was viciously killed b/c we can't secure our border? Stand up for US
...But while Dallas dropped to it knees as a team they ALL stood up for our National Anthem. Big progress being made - we love our country!
Expecting a great crowd of amazing people. Questions will be live! #TrumpToday
I will be on with @BretBaier tonight at 6PM. #Trump2016
Just arrived in Italy after having a very successful NATO meeting in Brussels. Told other nations they must pay more not fair to  U.S.
Big win in Montana for Republicans! We
.@TheJuanWilliams you never speak well of me & yet when I saw you at Fox you ran over like a child and wanted a picture. Please share pic!
My interview on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos had a 40%+ ratings increase over same Sunday last year. 20% over last week.
Thanks @PiersMorgan. You're great!
Once we OPEN UP OUR GREAT COUNYRY and it will be sooner rather than later the horror of the Invisible Enemy except for those that sadly lost a family member or friend must be quickly forgotten. Our Economy will BOOM perhaps like never before!!!
I will be doing the @TodayShow live from New Hampshire at 7am on Monday morning. #TrumpToday
Join me today Nov 3rd in #TrumpTowerNYC at noon. I'll be signing copies of my new book CRIPPLED AMERICA. Don't miss it!
Will be doing a sit down interview with  @JakeTapper @CNN on Sunday morning at 9:00. Tough questions and hopefully very good answers!
.@EWErickson is a total low life--- read his past tweets. A dummy with no "it" factor. Will fade fast.
I will be on @MeetThePress with @ChuckTodd tomorrow morning at 10:30am ET on @NBC. Enjoy!
.@EWErickson ran @RedState into the ground. A change was necessary. Congratulations to @RedState and good luck in the future!
....What right does Crazy Nancy have to hold up this Senate trial. None! She has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision. This Witch Hunt must end NOW with a trial in the Senate or let her default & lose. No more time should be wasted on this Impeachment Scam!
Tune in to see me on @ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos at 10am ET. Enjoy!
If @RepMarkMeadows @Jim_Jordan and Raul_Labrador would get on board we would have both great healthcare and massive tax cuts & reform.
....agricultural products from our Great Farmers in larger amounts than China ever did and ship it to poor & starving countries in the form of humanitarian assistance. In the meantime we will continue to negotiate with China in the hopes that they do not again try to redo deal!
Will be interviewed on @FaceTheNation with @JDickerson tomorrow at 10:30am EST. Enjoy!
....The process has begun to place additional Tariffs at 25% on the remaining 325 Billion Dollars. The U.S. only sells China approximately 100 Billion Dollars of goods & products a very big imbalance. With the over 100 Billion Dollars in Tariffs that we take in we will buy.....
In analyzing the Alabama Primary race Fake News always fails to mention that the candidate I endorsed went up MANY points after Election!
.@ThisWeekABC with @GStephanopoulos had fantastic numbers last Sunday --- Trump interview. Nice!
.@mercedesschlapp thank you so much for your kind words on television -- fantastic job and greatly appreciated!
The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough
I will be interviewed by @TheBrodyFile on @CBNNews tonight at 11pm. Enjoy!
Senator Feinstein and the Democrats  held the letter for months only to release it with a bang after the hearings were OVER - done very purposefully to Obstruct & Resist & Delay. Let her testify or not and TAKE THE VOTE!
Will he having a Press Conference at 5:45 P.M. See you in 15 minutes!
In our Country so much money has been poured down the drain for so many years but the Democrats fight us like cats and dogs when it comes to spending on Boarder Security (including a Wall) and the Military. We won on the Military it is being completely rebuilt. We will win...
Sleep eyes @ChuckTodd is killing Meet The Press. Isn't he pathetic? Love watching him fail!
Watch my interview with @ericbolling on @FoxNews today at 11:30AM ET
Great conversation with President Lenin Moreno of the Republic of Equador. We will be sending them desperately needed Ventilators of which we have recently manufactured many and helping them in other ways. They are fighting hard against CoronaVirus!
....trampled on our Constitution and they have done irreparable harm to our Republic. The American people are going to speak up and speak out about this. I think this guarantees Trump’s re-election in 2020." Jason Meister

....... I disagree but it's still cool.
.@jorgeramosnews Please send me your new number your old one’s not working. Sincerely Donald J. Trump

Good luck to Bob Kraft Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick tonight.
Tariffs will bring in FAR MORE wealth to our Country than even a phenomenal deal of the traditional kind. Also much easier & quicker to do. Our Farmers will do better faster and starving nations can now be helped. Waivers on some products will be granted or go to new source!
#CelebApprentice Another exciting episode -tune in next Monday at 8pm for 2 more new episodes!

Record crowd and standing ovation at Simpson College in Iowa- lots of fun wonderful audience!
#CelebApprentice I will be live tweeting(no spoilers) during tonight's all new @ApprenticeNBC at 8PM ET.
.@RollingStone admitted their scam. Phony @HuffingtonPost and others are no better-- total joke!
#CelebApprentice Selfies- yes or no?
We have tremendous economic power over China if our leaders knew how to use it which they don't! China's economy would collapse without us.
#CelebApprentice stay tuned for the 2nd half we have one more firing tonight!
#CelebApprentice  What do you think of the new teams/PMs?
#CelebApprentice We always make sure to have great NYC locations for the task delivery.
.@JTimberlake It was great having you play The Blue Monster. Thanks for your nice statements-many agree that it is best they've seen!
#CelebApprentice who do you think won?
Wow I just found out that in a major poll of its readers the @NewYorkObserver  voted me #1 on the "power 100" list in NY......
#CelebApprentice what do you think of the choices for project manager?
I will be live tweeting during the @ApprenticeNBC tonight at 9PM ET.
Congress has agreed to provide $8 Billion to fight Coronavirus! This means @CDC @HHSGov and @DHSgov will have the resources they need to Keep America Safe and keep the risk to workers and families very low. This is great news for our Health our Economy and our Nation!
"John Brennan no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the Intelligence community than this liar. He’s a liar about being a liar."
"@HoganSeaisle129: @realDonaldTrump who who who ... Say it just say it #CelebApprentice" Watch and see what happens!
Can you imagine with all of the talk about ObamaCare technical breakdowns made it a disastrous day. Our government is badly broken!
The Prosecutors who lost the case against SEAL Eddie Gallagher (who I released from solitary confinement so he could fight his case properly) were ridiculously given a Navy Achievement Medal....
....Not only did they lose the case they had difficulty with respect to information that may have been obtained from opposing lawyers and for giving immunity in a totally incompetent fashion....
.@JimRenacci has worked so hard on Tax Reductions Illegal Immigration the Border and Crime. I need Jim very badly to help our agenda and to keep MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! He will be a fantastic  Senator for the Great State of Ohio and has my full endorsement!
The National Guard has been activated In Minneapolis. They have arrived on the seen. George Floyd will not have died in vain. Respect his memory!!!
...& overwhelming" but this Scam Impeachment was neither. Also very unfair with no Due Process proper representation or witnesses. Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans weren’t allowed to have in the House. Dems want to run majority Republican Senate. Hypocrites!
....I have directed the Secretary of the Navy Richard Spencer and Chief of Naval Operations John Richardson to immediately withdraw and rescind the awards. I am very happy for Eddie Gallagher and his family!
Great businessman & philanthropist Bernies Marcus Co-Founder of Home Depot said that Congress was too distracted by the (phony) Impeachment Witch Hunt when they should have been investigating  CoronaVirus when it first appeared in China. Media played a big roll also!@dcexaminer
Why should I have the stigma of Impeachment attached to my name when I did nothing wrong. Read the Transcripts! Hose Republicans voted 195-0 plus we got three Dems. Very unfair to tens of millions of voters!
"What Really Happened"
There will never be an "Autonomous Zone" in Washington D.C. as long as I’m your President. If they try they will be met with serious force!
This Tweet from @realDonaldTrump has been withheld in: United States.
So now the Democrats are using Mail Drop Boxes which are a voter security disaster. Among other things they make it possible for a person to vote multiple times. Also who controls them are they placed in Republican or Democrat areas? They are not Covid sanitized. A big fraud!
.....go to your Polling Place to see whether or not your Mail In Vote has been Tabulated (Counted). If it has you will not be able to Vote & the Mail In System worked properly. If it has not been Counted VOTE (which is a citizen’s right to do). If your Mail In Ballot arrives....
....after you Vote which it should not that Ballot will not be used or counted in that your vote has already been cast & tabulated. YOU ARE NOW ASSURED THAT YOUR PRECIOUS VOTE HAS BEEN COUNTED it hasn’t been "lost thrown out or in any way destroyed". GOD BLESS AMERICA!!!
Flu season is coming up! Many people every year sometimes over 100000 and despite the Vaccine die from the Flu. Are we going to close down our Country? No we have learned to live with it just like we are learning to live with Covid in most populations far less lethal!!!
A total and complete sign off from White House Doctors yesterday. That means I can’t get it (immune) and can’t give it. Very nice to know!!!
....sound horrible an me sound guilty. HE WAS DESPERATE AND HE GOT CAUGHT. Adam Schiff therefore lied to Congress and attempted to defraud the American Public. He has been doing this for two years. I am calling for him to immediately resign from Congress based on this fraud!
What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are their only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe’s protection then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY not by 2025.`;
